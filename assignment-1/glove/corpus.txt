0,i just recently watched this 1954 movie starring vincent price for the first time on turner classic movies price portrays don gallico a magicianinventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions and also his wife portrayed in a brief role by the lovely eva gabor even though price is a murderer i actually found myself rooting for him he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of himalthough this movie doesnt have the horror factor of some of his more famous roles such as my favorite house of wax it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest this is a must for vincent price fans
1,i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site i would have to say it was worth the effort however you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes if you dont have the staying power get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nightsnow to the film what i say will contain spoilers and if you dont mind here goes alexandre is a promiscuous bum a womanizer and a gigolo he lives with an older woman called marie marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her at this point alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else by chance alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past marie and veronika struggles for alexs affection and had a ménage à trois to boot finally at the end its revealed veronika is pregnant with alexs child and alex asked her to marry him we assume as aforesaid with gilbertes situation alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family there is hope with the title of la maman et la putain i deduce jean eustache was relating to françoise lebruns character of veronika she was a whore and then she became the mother hence the mother and whore is the same person anyway what do i know french films are mostly not all very chatty aimlessly political preaching theatrical insipid lamenting and full of quotes lebrun and léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed not a bad effort 710
2,one of my favorite scenes is at the beginning when guests on a private yacht decide to take an impromptu swim  in their underwear rather risqué for 1931
3,i dont know why some people criticise that show so muchit is a great funny show  probably not the right material for mainstream primetime but stillthe family dynamics are funny and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent siegfried  roy jibes are only just above average but ever so often you have subplots or oneliners that make you roll on the floor laughingthis show was well worth the 8 pounds i paid for itrating 810
4,this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival but unlike yes by sally potter which i had seen some days before where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive this time quite the opposite thing happened there was something that dragged me down and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe it was as if all of a sudden there was nothing left all hope all future had been taken away to a dead placeninas life seemed to be dismal and locked but then one lovely day there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion just out of nothing someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life that person was toni a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots just like herselfbut the films title is ghosts and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish there is no way to retain them ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself hiding away from all other people françoise a french woman is a victim of such ghosts she once lost her child daughter in berlin who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket in just one moment of inattentiveness now time has passed and françoise is back in berlin still looking for the missing childnina could be that child after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heartshaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identityand nina adopts that idea after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion she also longs for a mother but in the end she is emptyhanded toni has disappeared with a man and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman marie is dead concludes françoises husband and the statement could not be more disillusioning nina is just a niña a girl without name there is no hope for any divine fulfillment there is no marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives therefore in the end we see nina all alone about to walk along the road that has opened up before her into a future that seems joyless and uncertain
5,margaritas and cockthis tremendously entertaining film grabs you from the opening scene and never stops delivering laughs surprises and unexpectedly touching moments i had more fun watching the matador than almost any other film from 2005 it is a wacky film with an unforgettable character played to perfection by pierce brosnanjulian noble brosnan is a facilitator hitman who specializes in highend corporate gigs assassinating rich dudes he is also experiencing something akin to a midlife crisis after coming to realization that he has no real friends no permanent home and no planned future he stumbles into a mexican hotel bar one night and runs into danny wright kinneardanny is a downonhisluck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him he loves his wife dearly especially so since they lost their young son a few years earlierthe two men are chalk and cheese hardly any common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one night and somehow a conversation is struck that sets in to motion a chain of events that will change their lives foreverthe friendship they form reminded me a lot of laurel and hardy one is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble the interplay is superbly timed and finely tuned due in no small part to the wonderful performances from brosnan and kinnearbut make no mistake this is brosnans film he imprints one of the most memorable and despicably likable characters of the decade he could shoot your mother and apologize immediately thereafter and youd probably forgive him brosnan may be cinemas ultimate charmer but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date i wouldnt be averse to seeing an oscar nod for this roleconsider one scene where he overtly ogles a highschool girl with the impurest of thoughts and utters the line all blushy blushy no sucky fucky he does it with the familiar bond smirk and manages to get away with it he manages to tell a young boy tell your mother to lose 30lbs and 20 years then get back to me without coming across as unlikable in fact it makes us like him even moreand yet the film manages to surprise us with some truly touching scenes most of which come toward the end when the film takes some unpredictable turns however when julian thumbs through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday or when danny and his wife davis console each other in their bedroom one night the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotionthe matador is stylish and energetic it is constantly entertaining and it contains a careerdefining role for brosnan as the lonely hitman looking for normalcy friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life this is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this film as soon as possibletc candler of independentcriticscom
6,hickory dickory dock was a good poirot mystery i confess i have not read the book despite being an avid agatha christie fan the adaptation isnt without its problems there were times when the humour and there were valiant attempts to get it right was a little overdone and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded however i loved how hickory dickory dock was filmed it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant abc murders and it really set the atmosphere what with the dark camera work and dark lighting the darker moments were somewhat creepy this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a poirot adaptation maybe not as disturbing as the one in one two buckle my shoe which gave me nightmares the plot is complex with all the essential ingredients though not as convoluted as buckle my shoeand in some way that is a good thing the acting was very good david suchet is impeccablei know i cant use this word forever but i cant think of a better word to describe his performance in the series as poirot and phillip jackson and pauline moran do justice to their integral characters brilliantly and the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole particularly damian lewis as leonard all in all solid mystery but doesnt rank along the best 7510 bethany cox
7,contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own riski loved this film the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen for instance in one scene leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen her face is huge in the back and leos is in the foregroundone of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close ups it reminded me of battleship potemkin that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtubyou can only see the red water on the side it is one of the things i love about von trier his understatement of horror which ends up making it all the more creepythe use of text in the film was unique like when leos character is pushed by the word werewolf i have never seen anything like that in a filmthe use of black comedy in this film was well done ernsthugo järegård is great as leos uncle it brings up the snickers i got from his role in the kingdom riget this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of ww2 and all the chaos easier to take it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them yet some people like leo are tuned in but do nothing positive about itthe voice over done expertly well by max von sydow is amusing too it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leos head which at times is a scary place to bethe movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they dont choose a side i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark where bjorks character doesnt speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction actually at one time von trier seemed antiwoman to me by making breaking the waves and dancer but now i know his male characters dont fare well either i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions but of course they never do
8,this film isnt just about a school shooting in fact its never even seen but that just adds to the power this film has its about people and how they deal with tragedy i know it was shown to the students who survived the columbine shooting and it provided a sense of closure for a lot of them the acting is superb all three main actors busy phillips erika christensen and victor garber are excellent in their rolesi highly recommend this film to anyone its one of those films that makes you talk about it after you see it it provokes discussion of not only school shootings but of human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy it is a tearjerker but it is well worth it and one i will watch time and time again
9,this is a very moving picture about 3 fortysomething best friends in a small england town one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you a powerful piece of work this is definitely one of my favorite films of all timespoiler spoiler alert spoilerthe main character is taken by her young handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms her two jealous friends play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back togetherin my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted
10,im not a follower of a certain movie genre i classify movies only as industrial or nonindustrial valentine is the second industrial movie of the director jamie blanks after his urban legends unlike urban legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak yet again unlike urban legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic and that is what makes valentine the best as the first basic and iconic element the growing hatred of the serial killer is so downtoearth since his secondary school years he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends who have made fun of him when you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie you will come to see this point of view of humanism noone is entirely good or evil in fact somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted just because the story line and the direction is very weak we are not as satisfied as we deserved the second iconic element is of course the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s super starlets my favourite is jessica cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed an arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in while she was playing hideandseek with her blind date never able to met with katherine heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables denise richards is killed third while she just found a valentines day gift for her at a whirlpool bath jessica capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer marley shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed finally benita ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer david boreanazthe third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene the valentines day celebration at dorothys house scenes and ultimately the killing themes everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as i know hard rock never suits better within a serial killermystery movie
11,this prodigal son and eastern condors are my favourite sammo hung films the fat dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in condors but hes no less surefooted as director or actor he is in fact at the top of his form and delivers a devastating brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate sweet love story also love and romance are not the directors priorities here but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action and insure that viewers dont hit the fastforward button between the physical clashesthe opening scene which features a funny light sabre duel sets a solid but deceptive tone a sequence in which sammos pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp comic tone the fast and furious stick fight between sammo and lau kar leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp superb direction and easily one of the best ever of its type the films violence escalates slowly until finally when the climactic showdown comes we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a sammo production the directoractors assault on billy chow and a house filled with angry menacing opponents is a bonecracking physically punishing delightterrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever madegreat score too
12,this film as low budget as it may be is one of the best psychological thrillers ive ever seen if you accept that its low budget from the start you can appreciate just how good of a story it is how very well written the script is and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little moneyall the elements of a great film are here the visuals though shot on digital were gorgeous in places the bizarre dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog that scene was just amazing its such a trippy piece of work but not done in a pretentious way and because of that i have a whole lot of respect for this film it comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there
13,this film has a special place in my heart as when i caught it the first time i was teaching adult literacy it rang very true to me and even an outstanding student i had at the time there are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation excellent performances by jane fonda and robert deniro that rank with their best work a great turn by a young martha plimpton an inspiring story line and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience

15,el mar is a tough stark utterly brilliant brave work of cinematic art director agustí villaronga with an adaptation by antoni aloy and biel mesquida of blai bonets novel has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives and though the focus is on wars heinous tattoo on children the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear this film becomes one of the finest antiwar documents without resorting to pamphleteering the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following childrens march toward adulthooda small group of children are shown in the spanish civil war of spain threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens ramala nilo mur tur david lozano julia sergi moreno and francisca victoria verger witness the terror of the assassination of men and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide these wideeyed children become adults carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their mindswe then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium ramala roger casamajor has survived as a male prostitute protected by his john morell juli mira and has kept his life style private tur bruno bergonzini has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to catholicism and the blur of delusional selfmutilationcrucifixion francisca antònia torrens has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium the three are rejoined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war tur longs for ramalas love ramala longs to be free from his morell and francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nuns habitthe setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death between lust and love and between devotion and destruction is played out to detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable for this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and director villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense the actors both as children and as adults are splendid roger cassamoor bruno bergonzini and antònia torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles the cinematography by jaime peracaula and the haunting musical score by javier navarrete serve the directors vision a tough film this but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath in spanish with english subtitlesgrady harp
16,vivah in my opinion is the best movie of 2006 coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career i am not too keen in romantic movies these days because i see them as old wine in a new bottle and so predictable however i have watched this movie three times nowand believe me its an awesome movievivah goes back to the traditional route displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage the movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do or would do when it comes to marriage in that sense sooraj r barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a wellmade highly entertaining movieseveral sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately  when shahid kapoor comes to see the bride amrita rao  the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family the song do anjaane ajnabi goes well with the mood of this scene the first conversation between shahid and amrita when he comes to see her  ie a shy shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation also amritas naive nature limited eyecontact shy characteristics and answering softly to shahids questions the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle alok nath when she feeds him at shahids party in the form of anothers daughterinlaw rather than her uncles beloved niececlearly the movie belongs to amrita rao all the way the actress portrays the role of poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectlyshahid kapoor performs brilliantly too he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than salman khan when it comes to acting in a sooraj r barjatya film in fact shahid and amrita make a cute onscreen couple without a shadow of doubt other characters  alok nath excellent anupam kher brilliant mohan joshi very goodon the whole vivah delivers what it promised a well made and realistic story of two families the movie has topnotch performances excellent story and great music to suit the film as well as being directed by the fabulous sooraj r barjatya its a must see
17,gespenster question of to be cool in the german cinemathere are not many german films in the last ten years who have made me so interest yes the problem of the most german films are in this film gespenster too he is on some places to uncooked to be good to see special the figure of toni sabine timento is too cool but thats is in german films always so everybody must to learns this coolneß  is the realism in this films thats difficult to understand but in this case it makes some sense because she steals and she lies  she is the kind of girl is better you never love it because you lose it thats not clear for the other girl nina in this film she love her  and she would lose her but nina lost everything she will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling there is no way  but you must take it said herbert achterbusch for twenty years thats so often the way it goes in german films why nina julia hummer is not inside of the laws of society  the is outside  and there she have no chance this films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside thats one of the problems  the stupid break with conventions  the criminal fascination throw it all away  and go nowhere but the actress plays this difficult part very interesting on the other side  there the parents  who are the pendant to the two girls the have a car  a hotel suite  the have money and live in world with music of the opera but the film stand always in some distance to seem there is no much explaining of themin the center of this film there is one scene you will never forget the two girls got to a casting and there they should say how they find together in this scene toni will lying on she said a fantastic storyhas nothing to do with her and then nina will say the truth she said it in an introversion way there is no exhibition in it she looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here thats a great moment in the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on than toni goes awayokay the film will end  in the german way of coolneß  rubbish  here the circle of sadness is closing but there was a moment  where is happening something else  and this moment was important he is more than german coolneß  and this moments are rare in the german cinema in this time
18,when i think of return of the jedi i think epic yeah ewoks were in there so what theyre an interesting add to the movie not to mention they are similar to the vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts jedi is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies emperor palpatine portrayed by the amazing theater actor ian mcdiarmid was one the best parts of the movie palpatine is so evil and vicious vader looks like mr rogers compared to him  speaking of darth vader what an amazing end to such an iconic character vader is truly a modern day greek tragedy and i think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after revenge of the sith came out his redemption at the end was moving and really brings a happy yet bittersweet feeling to you the best part was of course the special effects its amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with its graphics the scenes at jabbas palace leia looks amazing in that metal bikini and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at in all jedis deep plot and emotional moments primarily between luke vader and palpatine and when luke reveals the truth to leia and incredible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history

20,coming of age movies are quite usual these days for 1980 foxes really gives its meaning jodie foster plays her character straight out ever since she did taxi driver four years earlier she has a stronger character in this movie shes jeanie a high schooler who has plenty of guts and seems to get out of any situation shes in scott baio plays brad way before chachi on happy days hes deemed immature by the other girls cherie currie is annie hangs with the wrong crowd chased by her policeman father jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous annie is rescued by jeanie and brad all the time whenever she gets wasted reality comes back hard where she is killed in a automobile accident and one gets married to a much older man growing up isnt easy sometimes we got to explore life how it is in reality you got to be careful about the people surrounding you for me i was my own person and i tend to stay that way great music great plot this movies a gem 4 out of 5 stars
21,i was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start  every time i even thought going to bed something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtimethis movie could have been another easy slam dunk antigun film but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings and even better the movie kept on with the real life  just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie this film not only doesnt follow the formula it shows how other events often lead up to andor affect what happens afterwardsi only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around antidepressant drugs more  the kids from columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way deanna popped them every time the nightmares started up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have it was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film having a relative who suffers from a mental illness i can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues and for those who think certain things couldnt happen in a hospital i dont want to tell any particulars youre dead wrong on that too  ive been there the script was so real it was amazinggo buy this film and show it to your teenage kids before its too late someday theyll thank you for it
22,this supernatural peter weir thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating movies ever seen richard chamberlain does his best performance here as the australian lawyer who defends a group of young aborigins accused of murder as he gets closer on the case he discovers more about the main defendant chris and not least about himself chris tells him that he is a mulkurul which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in australia thousands of years ago at the same time extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the last wave the one that will drown the worldthe dream sequences and the supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience olivia hamnett and david gulpilil are solid in the supporting roles as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays charlie the old aborigin who can turn into an owl the climax and the ending dont disappoint in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so however this can not be called a pure thriller it is a drama as well and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world a masterful work by peter weir the master of visually stunning dramas
23,stanley and iris show the triumph of the human spirit for stanley its the struggle to become literate and realize his potential for iris its to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow the beauty of the movie is the dance that robert deniro and jane fonda do together starting and stopping before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on in that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is thus being credible unlike some other reviewers i found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture the supporting cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that the main characters get added meaning from the supporting performances all in all an excellent movie the best thing i take from it is hope
24,the storyline was rather interesting but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughtsbehavior more extreme than necessary also i think something went wrong in the casting john turtorro doesnt really satisfy me playing a semiautistic chess player not to speak of the italian player motives werent very much outlined either
25,riff randell is a wildly obsessed fan of the rock group the ramones and so are most of the students in the school but a new tyrant of a principal ms togar thinks rock n roll is a bad influence on the students especially the music from the ramones so when riff finds out theyre performing in town she skips class for a couple of days to get tickets for herself and her friends but when ms togar discovers why she really took those days off she confiscates the tickets while this is happening tom roberts is totally love struck over riff but riffs friend kate rambeau feels the same way about tom but riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer joe ramone and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her songfun fun fun yep thats right rock n roll high school doesnt drift away from it main focus a boisterously daggy romp it wasnt what i was expecting thats for sure everyone participating in this dandy project looks like theyre having a great time and the relaxing nature of it shows on screen with the energy providing such a glowing spirit which makes it a priceless experience thats not to say i think its art and the plot is as pointless as can be but watching this passionately crazy ride that escalates into some good harmless high jinks i just couldnt wipe the grin off my face its tacky very cheesy densely chaotic but damn its funkydory this lowbudget bgrade feature from producer roger corman and john dante who was cowriter  and plus he codirected some scenes when director allan arkush was hospitalised on the last day shoot is basically a glorious homage on the rocking 1950s flicks by sticking with the fruitful clichés and throwing into the stew the teenage rebellion tag because of the generation gap between them and the adults who always know best these features might not be particularly fresh but they do rack up some appeal because of the dynamically gusto treatment the film has just one thing on mind to go out on a bang and they manage to do that courtesy of the ramones who play themselves really you could say its one big trendy video clip since its all about the ramones well most of it anyway i see a lot flack towards the ramones acting ability these are musicians not actors which means its not about their acting here its the music were suppose to dig theyre here to perform which they deliver in that front with some kick ass tracks that peppered the film to create a totally upbeat vibe especially their flamboyant concert performances the buzzing soundtrack also had some killer tunes from some other artists such as devo the velvet underground mc5 fleetwood mack eddie and the hot rods and alice cooper but these jumping tracks fitted in well with the carefree feel and even the score was worked in rather well especially in the scenes involving ms togar with the score grasping the right mood that surrounds her mind set the playful mood of the film is pretty much like a roller coaster ride with such a racy pace between the electrifying tunes and comical segments ranging from scattered slapstick routines to its sometimes clever tongueincheek dialogue thrown in for good measure is a variety of light and heavy gags which i found very pleasurable and it gave it such a wider range to express itselfwhat else gave the film an added boost had to be the divine pj soles better known for her performance in halloween who gave such a bang up performance as the peachy riff randell other exemplary performances were dey young as the extremely cute kate rambeau vincent van patten as the gawky tom roberts and the go to man eaglebauer whos stupendously played by clint howard also some top drawer corman regulars pop up with great send up performances by mary woronov whos excellent as the demanding ms togar whos pushing her unfair reign on the students paul bartel as mr mcgree and a small support role from dick millar towards the end the enthusiastic acting is pretty campy but that goes down well with the material and theres a certain likability stemming from these characters but we totally despise ms togar and her hall monitor goonstheres no beating around the bush here when i say rock n roll high school is an intoxicating hoot of a rad time
26,both my friend and i thought this movie was well done we expected a light hearted comedy but got a full blown action movie with comic thrusts we both thought that this movie may have not done so well at the box office as the previews lead us to believe it was a comedy i was impressed with the supporting actors and of course dave morse always puts in a terrific acting job most of the supporting cast are veterans not first timers and they were solid we both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and made comments to each other about buying this movie if you dont buy rent it for a good time
27,its hard for me to criticize anything that mitzi kapture does she just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress that notwithstanding yes the plot was predictable i think perhaps if jill had slept with richard then it may have made him a little crazier than he already was which would have added more to the suspense it would have also been nice to see jill and her husband find out about richards little problem with his exwife maybe a bit more back story i was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie i would have liked to have seen more closure with zacks death and possibly closure with her husband i do have to say though i will never be able to look at a flare gun and not picture her standing there it was a very fitting end for richard of course mitzi rocked i am so looking forward to her future projects
28,this game was really great and quite a challenge it has a great spooky story line and the graphics are also very good i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish the only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just me a truly great game for rpg and shootemup fans
29,it is a rare occasion when i want to see a movie again the amati girls is such a movie in old time movie theaters i would have stayed put for more showings was this story autobiographical for the writerdirector it has the aura of realitythe all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness who would not want mercedes ruehl as an older sister i have loved her work since for roseannawith most movies one suspends belief because we know that it is the work of actors producers directors sound technicians etc it was hard to suspend such belief in the amati girls one feels such a part of this family how i wanted to come to the defense of dolores when her family is stifling her emotional life and wanted to cheer lee grant as she levels criticism at cloris leachmans hair color the humor throughout is not belly laugh humor but instead has a feelgood quality that satisfies far more than pratfalls and suchthe love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be emulated and cherishedit is no coincidence that the family name amati translated from the italian means the loved ones
30,this movie is a great way for the series to finally end peter the boy from puppet master iii is all grown up and is now the puppet master well this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn toulons secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii puppet master iii puppet master 4 puppet master 5 curse of the puppet master and retro puppet master sorry but i guess paramount wouldnt let them use scenes from 1 personally i wish puppet master vs demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say this is the final movie in the series
31,i gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie but for its pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience the story of onewomansstruggleagainstallodds is an old cliché by now but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as the color purpleit also showed a different side to the africanamerican experience  showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated white man and were abusive of their own people i find this an important point as it goes against the portraywhiteonblackviolenceandwinanoscar trendalso the acting performances are superb  especially oprah who i now have a new found respect forwell worth watching  but keep some tissue handy
32,father of the pride  was another of those good shows that unfortunately dont have a very long life  and that is pretty sad specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air  think in the simple life  i admit that are many similarities with this show and the simpsons but despite the similarities the show have it own merits  the animation is just adequate not incredible but is good the best are the characters  all the animals are very likable and funny  and even sigfried and roy had their moments  the music was good i liked many of the songs even if the show isnt very original i think that this had lots of potential like mission hill  a show that isnt very famous but i liked a lot  this didnt have the appreciation that it deserved  what a shame 
33,i only wish that return of the jedi have been directed by somebody else i mean there is far too much ewoks scenes completely unnecessary besides this time our heroes look like different people princess leia no longer fights with solo luke looks boring darth vader is not as evil as before and yoda just diesbut there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just cant hate itsome spoilers 1 jabba the hut 2 the sail barge attack sequence 3the emperor now thats evil 4 the speeders chase at the endor forest 5the last battle 6the dark side seduction scene 7the return of anakin to the good side of the force 8 and the last celebrationsome of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes if some scenes would have been cut and another director was hired this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5 but still is extraordinary 9 out of 10
34,upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times i have viewed it the acting is stunningly wonderful the characters are very clearly drawn brad pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels the other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western montana all in all this is one of the finest films made in the 1990syou must see this movie
35,firsttime director tom kiesche turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting dark comedy shot on a shoestring budget yet had the flavor of the early coen brothers film blood simple  and throw in some monty python flavorings to boot needs to seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next expect more good things to come from this writerdirectoractor
36,ok here is how i do this i grade movies on 10 components each component will inherently start with 5 points it can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0mood action romance comedy drama suspense  i give this component 10 points it had a perfect balance of all five aspects the action was fun and exiting the romance was not overdone but still very emotional and moving i laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still i was captivated by the fantastic drama and riveting suspenseplot  i give this component 10 points i thought all the good fairy tales had already been told i found my self sitting in the theatre returned to my childhood and in that instant i again believed in unicorns wicked witches and falling stars that make dreams come truecinema photography  i give this component 8 points while the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles i found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camerafx  i give this component 10 points i love that they used cgi sparingly the epic scenes were believable the magical powers were frighteningly realistic all in all less is more and this had it all cast  i give this component 10 points no names and seasoned actors alike the cast was amazing michelle pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked charlie cox made tristan come to life claire danes gave emotion to the stars and i will never look and robert de niro the same againacting  i give this component 10 points even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection once again i will never look and robert de niro the same againcharacter development  i give this component 9 points this felt a little rushed and i think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justicedialogue  i give this component 10 points the dialogue was smart witty fun even the mush had good dialoguescore  i give this component 7 points i can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie i am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorableending  i give this component 9 points almost perfect ending i feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced while others could have been more subdued but no threads were left untiedtotal 93 buy the dvd hel yes see it in the theatre most definitely bottom line excellent movie for everyone epic i strongly recommend seeing it in the theatre i know ill be going back for seconds
37,ghost story the tv movie1972 was the pilot for the nbc series the movie was wellwritten and wellacted and i thought when the 197273 tv season started if the tv series is half as good as the movie then nbc has a winner i wish this film was available on video the series was a colossal disappointmenteven with william castle as exec producer if howeveryou have a chance to see the original tv movie ghost story check it out you wont be disappointed
38,much like the comedy duo of its title the sunshine boys has become a forgotten classic 30odd years later its hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the 1970s this makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film perhaps the best neil simon ever wrotewalter matthau plays willy clark once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as lewis and clark now a bitter 73yearold solo act who cant get a job in a potato chip commercial his nephew and agent ben richard benjamin is sure he can get work if willy will only agree to reunite with his estranged partner al lewis george burns for an abctv celebration of show business nostalgianostalgia is what sunshine boys has going for it in spades right from the start when a series of 1920s film clips showcasing various entertainers from long ago flickers before us to the accompaniment of cole porters be a clown then theres the films presentday setting in manhattan where flared trousers and wide polyester ties abound the periods collide in willys glorious mess of a manhattan apartment where framed photos and cartoons of longdead celebrities stare out from the walls at lurid tabloid headlines and empty zabar grocery bags if you were alive in the 1970s like me you might even feel like you were in that apartmentwilly clearly has been living there too long hes sleeping in front of the television when the kettle in the other room boils willy wakes up and picks up the phonehello who is this a pause never mind its the teaold men living alone can be sad material in almost anyone elses hands but simons deft wit and unerring feeling for character turns this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit into comedy gold the amazing thing about the sunshine boys is how much it rubs your noses in willys almost existential condition without turning you off at all 89 years old and just like that he dies of nothing willy says of one old songwriting friend before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed lady with babyburns won an oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but steely lewis but its matthau who brings this one home his makeup and proud but ragged bearing really selling you on the idea he was already 73 when he made this willy is obnoxious in the extreme fully deserving bens description crazy freakin old man but you root for him throughout enjoying his small victories even when they come at the cost of others patience his lines kill you too especially when hes trying to kill lewis for whom the tv reunion turns out to be a bad ideayoure out of touch willy tells lewis at one point im still in demand im still hotif this room was on fire you wouldnt be hot lewis repliesdirector herbert ross shoots everything in a very casual and understated way with low lighting and midrange shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the films overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance you never get the feeling you are watching a movie one of the sunshine boys many charms and rosss direction like the acting of the three principals goes a long way toward achieving that endcomedy is hard especially when the subjects are people watching life pass them by but the sunshine boys makes it all seem a pleasure because for us watching it is
39,okay there are a ton of reviews here what can i possibly addi will try anyway the reason this is my favorite scrooge is because of everything the sets outdoor locations costumes are so beautiful and authentic the music is sweet the supporting cast is very well done one of my favorites is the narrator  nephew played by roger rees his understated sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of christmas to me david warner is also a totally believable bob cratchit his is a difficult life but he remains positive and dignified the best part of course is george c scott as ebenezer scrooge some have said his portrayal too gruff i couldnt disagree more his exchanges at the beginning while cold or harsh werent out of character he is a terribly disillusioned man whos heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own lust for wealth during the flashbacks its obvious that he isnt all gruff this is where we see that there is hope for him if he was totally gone his partner marley would never have come for his sake in the first place and after all we are none of us past hoping i think that is a huge part of what dickens was trying to say when scrooge looks in on his dance at his employers with belle you see him smile regretfully as he tells belle in the flashback that he will go through life with a grin on my face clive donner was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film sometimes they get left on the editing room floorand finally his conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy every time i see it his apology to his nephew fred so sincere so moving it is the spirit not only of christmas but of humanity itself the joy he brings to fred to his wife are so apparent and the line that gets me every time god forgive me for the time ive wasted bravi tutti
40,have to be honest and say that i havent seen many independent films but i thought this one was very well done the direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction the angles settings and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped many haunting and memorable images from the film stick in your mind long after its over always a sign of a good director
41,for those of you who love lord of the rings and love special effects watch this movie this will be sure to keep you glued to the screen you will probably even like it if you like watching people fight with magical stuff
42,the setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of dickens classic tale george c scott is very believable as is the rest of the cast his scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie then his character changes to one who is truly repentant the 19th century english town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film it is a movie i watch every christmas along with the real grinch and its a wonderful life
43, possible spoilers i like this film and have no problem staying awake for it it reminds me of me at 20 except this is even better like veronica says two chicks at one time it brings out the horniness in me the casual conversation these two real life chicks rather than hookers teasing us every step of the way i get into the conversations too even if they are utterly bs at times so what every chick just about that ive ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous selfcentered bs philosophy its just a bunch of nonsense and about as sensible as that other bs philosophy chicks are often into astrological charts the only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women hes into the same bs and moodiness the brunette chick is actually the most masculine person therei think its kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by veronica shed love to pull the little blonde away from alexander but veronica plays her all the way shes brilliant she gets the brunette thinking theres something up between them and then she steals the boychildman which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group the brunette knows shes been had by the end when shes dropping her face into the palms of her hands while marlene deitrich sings in the background that paraphrasing there are a million couples in paris tonight but i only have this refrainbut do they get married in the end alex and veronica mmmm i can only imagine a supertumultuous relationship ending in a premarriage breakup they are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stonesi like the film though it kept me entertained its got a nice look and its sexy
44,you could stage a version of charles dickens a christmas carol with sock puppets and ill probably watch it ever since i was a child this has been one of my favorite stories maybe its the idea that there is good in everyone and that therefore no one is beyond redemption that appeals to me but for whatever reason i never miss an opportunity to watch one of the many screen adaptations of this timeless classic when theyre on tv as they inevitably are this time of yearwhat makes this version really stand out is the somber gravitas that the cast bring to their respective roles lines weve heard dozens of times in the past take on a whole new intensity and each character becomes more real and believable in the hands of this wonderful ensemblegeorge c scott was nominated for an emmy in 1985 for this role it is to his everlasting credit that rather than sleepwalking through this oftportrayed role of scrooge he instead gave it a fresh interpretation that was in my opinion one of his finest performances ever he wisely did not attempt a british accent instead delivering his lines in that famous gravelly voice his scrooge is not merely a cranky old man as he is so often portrayed but a man who harbors a profound anger against the world as he is visited in turn by each of the three spirits we understand how this anger took root grew and ultimately strangled his soul as he is forced to review his life we see him alternately softening and then relapsing again into unrepentant obstinacy and in the great dramatic scene when he kneeling and weeping at his own grave begs for mercy as he attempts to convince the third spirit of his repentance and desire to alter his life we see a man who has been utterly broken and brought to his knees literally and figuratively scott has made scrooge utterly believable and painfully humanimpressive as scotts performance is the ensemble of supporting actors contributes significantly the this versions dark beauty fred holywell scrooges nephew is an excellent example of this often portrayed as an affable buffoon here he is played by roger rees with an emotional intensity missing from earlier portrayals when he implores scrooge i ask nothing of you i want nothing from you why cant we be friends we see in his face not only his frustration but his pain at scrooges selfimposed separation from his only living relative it is a moving performance and one of the movies most dramatic sceneseven more magnificent is the performance given by the wonderful english actor frank finlay as scrooges late partner jacob marley in most versions of this tale the scene with marley tends to be a bit of a low point in the film simply because its difficult to portray a dead man convincingly and the results are usually just plain silly ooooh look its a scary ghostnot in this version it is perhaps the most riveting scene in the whole movie marleys entrance as the locks on scrooges door fly open of their own accord and the sound of chains rattling echo throughout the house is wonderfully creepy but finlays marley is no ethereal spirit he is a tortured soul inspiring both horror and pity marley may be a ghost but his rage and regret over a life wasted on the pursuit of wealth and his despair at his realization that his sins are now beyond redress are still very human as portrayed by finlay we have no problem believing that even the flinty scrooge would be shaken by this nightmarish apparition finlay really steals the scene here something not easy to do when youre opposite george c scottand it just goes on and on one remarkable performance after another making it seem like youre experiencing this story for the first time edward woodward remember him from the equalizer is by turns both jovial and menacing as the ghost of christmas present when he delivers the famous line it may well be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor mans child he is no longer a jolly santa claus surrogate but an avenging angel who gives scrooge a much needed verbal spankingsusannah york is a wonderfully tart tongued mrs cratchit and david warner brings marvelous depth to the long suffering bob cratchit a man who goes through life bearing the triple crosses of poverty a sick child and an insufferable boss his face alternately shows his cheerful courage and also at times his weariness in the face of intolerable circumstances later in the scene in which scrooge is shown by the ghost of christmas yet to come the cratchit family after the death of tiny tim warners performance while hardly uttering a word will move you to tears
45,this is one amazing movie you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical there are always stories behind stories i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore i studied them in schoolit is very complicated you just have to take what it gives youenjoy the movie and enjoy the ridehooray
46,who done it contains many surefire laughs and gags it is not only one of the best stooges films with shemp it is one of the finest short comedies columbia produced director bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the stooges but when curly howard suffered a careerending stroke it was tailored for the columbia comedy team of schilling and lane their version was released as pardon my terror it obviously was too good for the stooges to pass up and it was finally filmed by the stooges at the end of 1947old man goodrich calls ace detectives shemp larry and moe out of fear that he will be murdered when they arrive at his home goodrich has disappeared and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the stooges will they find goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice shemp is particularly funny in this film his reactions after being given a mickey by christine mcintyre are superb he gives his trademark sound eeebeeebeeeb and miss mcintyre is noticeably trying not to laugh other funny scenes the closeup of moes mug looking through the camera lens and the inthedark fight with all cast members involvednikko the goon played by duke york is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a stooges film with his kinked hair he could almost pass for a stooge if he didnt tower over everyone else who done it is a gem among the stooges films with shemp even diehard curly fans will enjoy this one a true stooge classic 9 out of 10
47,call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series if you havent had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series you should definitely watch this one perhaps more compelling than that of voyagers caretaker which launched the series with cpt janeway archers adventures are completely different yet strangely familiarthe music is catchy too no true scifi fan can go without seeing at least one star trek episodeand these installments make the wait worthwhile
48,the beautiful story of stardust is written by by neil gaiman writer of mirrormask and its really a good story i think it would appeal to any labyrinth princess bride or 10th kingdom fan and yet its totally unique and stands up on its own and i feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by neil gaiman i wont spoil it for youthe main character tristan tristran in the novel is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie the story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world when there is a falling star tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with he is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again and some bickering princesits a really good story it has humor and magic and beautiful surreal scenes and visuals its charming and i feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages its simply magical its a true classic fairy tale the likes of which i havent seen in cinema since the 1980s
49,i viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend my wife and her female friend so i had views from all kinds of directions mainly the film made me laugh the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were tudor chirila and maria popistasu yes i do think she played her role well even if the script was not appropriate there were good romanian actors around they just didnt have complex roles i applaud puyas entering the movie business i dont know why but i think hes a good guy i just hope hell be a good actorthe wife loved the movie though and i think there might have been chords being played and to which i had no ear for if the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays romania then it failed miserably there were no consequences just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl and the same story becomes just a boring uninteresting ploti have no idea why it got all those bafta awards in my book it should have gotten the better luck next time award baftagood luck in romanian
50,a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend of course the sob is very goodlooking charming etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman watching jean pierre leauds character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends its tragic and you know shes going to end up very hurt but theres nothing you can do leaud is brilliant totally empty a blank throughout he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wantsthe scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love and the next morning he puts on a record and very sweetly and charmingly sings along to amuse her is brilliant the what the hell am i doing here with this idiot expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to comeits a long film but see it in one go preferably in a cinema takes a while to get into but then the time just disappears
51,this is apparently one of shemps first shorts with the stooges this excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team but the threesomes comedic timing is at its honed best here aside from the intense slapstick scenes there are others more subtle but just as funny watch larry when shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot or watch the real object prompting moes exclamation ohhighly polished mahoganyemil sitka is at his bewildered goofiest and the goon may look scary but hes somehow funny he seems as frustrated and perplexed with the stooges as are regular people in other shortsfor shemp aficionados this is a must have episode it wont disappoint
52,very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win itjohn toturro plays a psychologically challenged man nothing matters to him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces the game validates him as a person when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a beautiful fashioneven the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existenceit makes you wonder if there other luzons out there who obsess about the gamei am sure they areif you are a chess enthusiast it wont hurt to watch itits an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed wellit achieves its objectivesunfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel
53,this is simply one of the finest renditions of dickens classic tale the script very accurately follows the story originally penned by dickens and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of choicegeorge c scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of scrooge and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts i found that he was able to win me over to the point where i sympathized with the old miser something rarely done in other versions the superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production which is simply the most enjoyable of all the christmas carol versions i have seen
54,this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of marion davies she is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film i believe that lucille ball may have modeled her later career on davies style that could be termed zany beauty vidors direction is light but surehanded the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary and the starwatching element for fans of the silent era with many cameos adds to the overall fun it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well for all movie fans who have a kneejerk reaction to watching silent films sit through this one and it may change your attitude 
55,i really liked this movie of course the idea is pretty much out therethe federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an smalltime thief to lure a more dangerous thiefcomputer hacker out of hiding but alvin sanders the man who the feds have volunteered to be implanted with the device is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a goodhumored but passive or onedimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem definetly worth a watch
56,telefilms tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule which is why this film always tends to buck the trendgeorge c scott embodies ebenezer scrooge perfectly fully encompassing all of his cold tendencies and still makes him a simpathetic character the production value for this film was exceptional never relying on boffo special effects or soundstage setups yet relying on the depth and clarity of onsite shooting and strong backdrops a movie that certainly stands alone
57,have you seen the graduate it was hailed as the movie of its generation but a river runs through it is the story about all generations long before dustin hoffmans character got all wrapped up in the traps of modern suburbia norman maclean and his brother paul were facing the same crushing pressures of growing up as they tried to find their place in the world but how could a place like post ww1 montana be a showcase for the american family at a time when the wild west still was not completely gone just what has maclean tapped into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves as the movie opens norman is an old man flyfishing beside a rushing river trying to understand the course his own life has taken the movie is literally a journey up through his own stream of consciousness against times current and back to when he was a boy he and his younger brother paul were the sons of a presbyterian minister and devoted mother the parents fit snugly into their roles mom takes care of house and home dad does the work of the lord the boys ponder what they will be when they grow up norm has it narrowed down to a boxer or a minister like his dad given the choice little paul would be the boxer since hes told his first choice of pro flyfisherman doesnt even exist the boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks fight to see who is tougher and do the things brothers do all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like flyfishing they are at similar points in their lives before college but when norm returns from his six years at dartmouth things are very different paul is at the top of his game master flyfisherman grad of a nearby college and newspaper reporter who knows every cop on the beat and every judge on the bench norman is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life even as his father grills him about what he intends to do youre left feeling that at least to pops god will call you to your lifes work but you have to stay open and ready to receive it  all your life father has always taken his boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate gods eternal words listen their father urges its both zen and quakerly pretty radical for a stoic clergyman but with all the beauty and contemplation and even though the macleans are truly a godfearing scriptureheeding household how is it that rev macleans family is unraveling paul is true perfection as he fishes the river but hes feeling the pull of gambling and boozing while his family doesnt know how to keep him from winding up where he seems to be headed mom dad and brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they cant seem to help pauly just waves it all off with a grin and his irresistible charm but the junior brother is losing his grip norman starts getting his life on track finding love and career but paul continues to slide the family that loves him watches helplessly mother father brother flounder in their own ways trying to help but none very effectively how can a family that loves each other so much be so illequipped to handle this how can someone be so artful and full of grace when out in gods nature yet be somehow unfit or unwilling to fit into the constructs of society that gods peoples have made for themselves these are all questions norman will ponder his entire life the eternal words beneath the smooth stones of the river forever haunt him yet keep their secrets the movie is beautiful to watch this is certainly gods country and filming it won an oscar director robert redford plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern hes presenting and it works well but do go back and read the book too youll see norman made connections with his old man even deeper than the movie can suggest  and youll see the places where the storytellers very words gurgle and sing right off the page with an exuberance of a river running through it leading into the unknown
58,an axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first once again the casting is just wonderful i like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and clevernessthe second episode is just very funny very silly and very enjoyable it is the very first christmas episode about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as santa after having killed her own husband just like the first episode karmathe most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call first faking her fear until it becomes real
59,except for an awkward scene this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along except for one of the robert deniro scenes that doesnt come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done in the updated tradition of the princess bride this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating eight out of ten stars
60,since my third or fourth viewing some time ago ive abstained from la maman et la putain while i wait for the dvd in the meantime ive read the french screenplay as well as alain philippons monograph on jean eustache the latter ends with a frustrating filmography eleven films fiction doc and inbetween impossible to see or in the cases of mes petites amoureuses and le père noël reseea few questions that hit me this moment polish véronikas french is plenty colloquial un maximum d un maximum d even so does she have an accent i think i can tell she does what does the absence of color add especially at the single spot the fringe of the city is glimpsed how does this fringe differ from the sleep and journey that separates worlds of the tempest and the winters tale ditto alphaville we may imagine the elapsed years since have done it but does eustache deliberately circumscribe the films milieu is this an enchanted isle is alexandres a fairy tale alexandres always choreographing himself worrying about how or where to stand or walk what to say when announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does or is this his way of trying to choreograph others by doing it to himself how different is he from vertigos scottie i say i think very whats the difference and is there one between eustaches léaud and truffauts and godards how different is the present léaud isnt he still doing it whatever it is in recent roles irma vep le pornographe whatever approaching old age once i arrived early for one in a series of mostly antoine doinel léauds character truffaut films for a long while every three or five minutes down the aisle would come a twentysomething male in scarf tweedy coat léaud hair with a directionseeking nose i have no idea whether this was conscious or unconscious mimicry i was that age but have no idea what i myself looked like then no scarf at least i do have a brother though who seems to have learned his carriage from bresson
61,europa zentropa is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago this film is truly unique and a work of genius the camerawork and the editing are brilliant and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experiencethe participation of barbara suwkowa and eddie constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed max von sydow provides his great voice as the narratora one of a kind movie four stars highest rating
62,home room really surprised me in comparison to other movies that were written regarding columbine high school this one is the best home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town the movie focus on two opposite characters aleciabusy phillips and deannaerika christensen alecia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting she seems to show no emotion about it deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim alecia is forced to visit deanna at the hospital in order to graduate meanwhile the police are investigating alecia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen alecia and deanna are very different and do not get along at first eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends very much in the style of the breakfast club home room beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting i would recommend this film to anyone and everyone
63,the production quality cast premise authentic new england waterbury ct locale and lush john williams score should have resulted in a 34 star collectors item unfortunately all we got was a passable 2 star decent flick mostly memorable for what it tried to dobring an art house style film mainstream the small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself and if well done will satisfy most grownups jane fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable i wondered why she wasnt doing a post doctorate at yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in waterbury robert diniros character was just a bit too contrived an illiterate nice guy loser who turns out to actually be with a little help from janes character a 1990 version of henry ford or thomas edisonthis genre has been more successfully handled by nobodys fool in the mid 90s and this years 2003 about schmidt i wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those effortsill give it an a for effort
64,i just read the plot summary and it is the worst one i have ever read it does not do justice to this incredible movie for an example of a good summary read the listing at turner classic movies anyway this was one of my favorite movies as a young child my sister and i couldnt wait until every april when we could see it on tv it is one of the best horse movies of its time it is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch the romance is clean and endearing the story line is interesting and the songs are great they dont make movies like this anymore good acting and not over the top pat boone and shirley jones are at their best along with many other great character actors
65,steven spielberg wanted to win an oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldnt win by directing special effects epics he was nominated for three of them close encounters of the third kind raiders of the lost ark and et the extraterrestrial so he decided to get very serious by directing the color purple a period film with no special effects spielbergs first serious drama is a remarkable movie but the academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didnt give spielberg any respect the color purple received 11 oscar nominations including best picture but spielberg was unfairly snubbed when he wasnt nominated for best director it got worse on oscar night when this film didnt win a single oscar it got completely shut out that wasnt right the color purple should have won a couple of oscars including one for whoopi goldbergs spectacular film debut as celie a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband frightfully placed by danny glover then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends oprah winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as sofia one of those friends of celie since im from chicago i had already known winfrey from her talk show which at the time of this films release hadnt gone nationwide like goldberg what a film debut margaret avery is terrific as shug avery another friend who also happens to be the mistress of celies rotten husband all three actresses received welldeserved oscar nominations for their work here goldberg for best actress winfrey and avery for best supporting actress set in the south during the first half of the 20th century the color purple is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end it also made me laugh at times too why academy voters were so hard on not nominating spielberg for best director is a mystery that still puzzles me today but spielberg would eventully go on to win two oscars years later for schindlers list and saving private ryan making him one of the best movie directors of alltime but he should have gotten nominated for this movie the job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like et to a serious drama like the color purple was remarkable out of four
66,why is this movie not in the 250 best this movie looks still astoundingly fresh 56 years after its production but it could only have been made at the aftermath of wwii because of the perception of the nearness of death people were more aware that life could be stopped at one unexpected moment and what after life i liked the scene at the end with the judgment and all people of all nations gathered the phlegmatic judge abraham sofaera typical british judge doctor reeves roger livesey defending peter carter david niven and also june kim hunter against the american prosecutor abraham farlan raymond massey i there is a reason why it is an american it is all so imaginative michael powell wrote directed and produced this astonishing movie which is a real tourdeforce the message of the movie is clear in the universe the law is the most important but on earth nothing goes beyond the love between humans the way in which this beautiful story is told is far more interesting than any hollywoodmovie could ever make
67,loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel managerthe movie was presented well with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter the progression of situations were cleverly writtenmaking me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what i thought might be the obvious too bad there have to be commercialsi have told many friends to watch for further showings and i of course will view againi enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue husband and wife heated discussionsor should i say fights were very realisticthe initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the story presented fortunately is noti want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film thank you looking forward to the next filmswhen whidbey
68,and this is a great rocknroll movie in itself no matter how it evolved at point being a movie about disco it ended up as one of the ultimate movies in which kids want to rock out but the principal stands in their way think back to those rocknroll movies of the 50s in which the day is saved when alan freed comes to town with chuck berry to prove that rock  roll music is really cool and safe for the kids and tuesday weld gets a new sweater for the dance forward to the 1979 repeat the same plot but throw in da ramones whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century and then for the obligatory dj guest shot the real don steele throw in too all the elements of a roger cormanproduced comedyexploitation film except for the twoday shooting schedule some of the familiar corman repertory players like clint howard mary wournow and dick miller there since bucket of blood and youve got one of the great stoopid movies of the day one of the few films that uses deliberate cheesiness and gets away with it i showed the new dvd to a friend who could only remember seeing parts of it through a stoner induced haze at the drivein and he agreed that this is one of the great movies to be watching drunk not the least for the lovely leading ladies and the great ramones footage
69,i used this film in a religion class i was teaching the golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment a young boy and his mother are away from home the boy has been given money to buy milk on the way home he stops at carnival to play a game next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary the boy drops the bottle of milk it breaks the man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk this scene alternates with what is happening at home a black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment he discovers the fish bowl and watches it the fish swims energetically and flips out of the bowl by now a bunch of teenagers in my class and i have fallen in love with the fish the cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath the cat drops the fish into the bowl the double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat both inspire prejudice both are innocent it was a great discussion starter in my class
70,i like many diehard trekkers or trekkies i dont care suffered through seven seasons of star trek voyager dreaming of a better show when it was over lamenting the end of deep space nine in 1999 prayers answered enterprise is fantastic fresh perspective radically different characters stunning new visuals a popsong for the intro i was shocked i cant think of anything i didnt like sign me up for 10 seasons of this show star trek is back  voyager nobody misses you keep on trekkin
71,i expected something differentmore passiondramaagain another failed attempt of originalityim sorry to say that the film falls into the old cliché of cheesiness15 year old teens may appreciate it thoughthe acting was not very convincing and the lines commonlacking any witstill the soundtrack was good and well adaptedi cant say that this movie is a total flopbecause people do watch it but it didnt meet the publics expectations and sunk into mediocritysoto concludethe production keeps you in front of the tv for almost an hour and a halfwhich is an appreciable thingthusi guess its worth seeing if you dont get annoyed
72,a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend of course the sob is very goodlooking charming etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman watching jean pierre leauds character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends its tragic and you know shes going to end up very hurt but theres nothing you can do leaud is brilliant totally empty a blank throughout he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wantsthe scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love and the next morning he puts on a record and very sweetly and charmingly sings along to amuse her is brilliant the what the hell am i doing here with this idiot expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to comeits a long film but see it in one go preferably in a cinema takes a while to get into but then the time just disappears
73,riget ii is a good sequel but not quite as good as the first one this series dont seem to be quite as serious as the first one there are much more comedy in this good one thoughwere back at the danish rigshospitalet the danish national hospital mrs drusse is just about to leave the hospital as her work is done but fate wants it otherwise she is soon chasing ghosts and helmer is doing everyone mad and its soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the kingdomthis story involves a lot more comedy that the previous by all means lot of fun but it makes you take the series a little less serious the story has kept a lot of elements from the last series and added some new ones its well written but some of the new elements are just kind of silly but they save it by making it more like a comedy good story but not as good original and thrilling as the first seriesthe actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast they are all very good its an odd story and setting some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show so to keep it serious and keep it real is not an easy job yet these actors handle this whole situation perfectlymuch of the good qualities from the first series are kept intact the cinematography is one of those qualities the handheld camera that made trier world famous gives suspense and reality to the series it gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and trier makes use of these abilities good movement great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watchbe prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first also be prepared to see some more i didnt think that green thing looked all too good thought it was unoriginal and didnt fit never the less the effects like the ghosts are really good the nondigital effects looks good too little brother looks just really odd but you accept it all over id say effects are from ok to goodthe music is also quite good moody and nice some of it are really touching it fits really nice as the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very wellall together this makes a good sequel if youd seen riget you can see this one without being disappointed it has many of the same qualities as the first series however i would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this these two makes up a series you dont wanna miss
74,carla works for a property developers where she excels in being unattractive unappreciated and desperate she is also deafher boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company help arrives in the form of paul a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environmentan implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week when carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits pauls criminality by having him steal the contract back the colleague quickly realises that shes behind the robbery but when he confronts her pauls readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too  but this thuggery comes at a price paul is given a going over by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt he formulates a plan which utilises carlas unique lip reading abilities to ripoff a gang of violent bank robbers its now carlas turn to enter a frightening new worldthe fourth feature from director jacques audiard read my lips begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners the leads are excellent effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect carlas first meeting with paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was until very recently a jailbird emmanuelle devos who plays carla has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame vincent cassel plays paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when hes receiving a beating or concocting the ripoff that is likely to get him killedlike many french films read my lips appears at first to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that its probably about everything the only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of pauls parole officer a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood culdesacit was the french new wave of the 60s that first introduced the concept of genre to film making and ive always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it so its always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre or better still defy it
75,walter matthau and george burns just work so well together the acidity of willy with the perplexed amnesic al is a mixture made in heaven the scene when they meet again in willys flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection walter matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semiretired comedian as only he can the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization george burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable watch for the scene near the end when al and his daughter ask something of the spanish caretaker and als reaction  priceless
76,my alltime favorite movie oscarcaliber work by everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera the screenplay is perfect and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george briggs in a completely satisfying way unlike the novel the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike newell and cinematographer rex maidment it is josie lawrences best work by far and transformed my opinion of joan plowright having watched this movie at least 50 times i can find no fault in it the music by famed composer richard rodney bennet is a marvel
77,this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen i was about 12 years old when i watched it for the first time and whenever it is on tv i my eyes are glued to it the acting and plot are amazing it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama
78,i was reviewing some old vhs tapes i have and came across the tv show john denver  the muppets a christmas togetherthis made me go to my computer and look it up to see if i could find a dvd version of this show to buy i was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on dvd the show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show i have the record and the cd but i would love to buy a dvd version of this show the tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading the sound is not as good as the cd there is also a few other songs not put on the cd as a fan of john denver and of the muppets a dvd of this show would really be a good seller if you dont have the cd it is a wonderful chritmas collection of songs taken from that show the album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on
79,this movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made ive seen this movie for the first time a week ago since then every day i see the opening and every time i feel as thrilled as i felt the first time i heard david niven uttering the immortal words from sir walter raleighs the pilgrimagegive me my scallopshell of quiet my staff of faith to walk upon my scrip of joy immortal diet my bottle of salvation my gown of glory hopes true gage and thus ill take my pilgrimage do you know why it would be a truism to say michael powells and emeric pressuburgers lives are thoroughly justified for having crafted such a wonderful opening because they had been already admitted in the paradise of poets long before they made this moviei imagine both of them facing trial during doomsday and saying nonchalantly to an irate god i beg your pardon sir so do you want to know what have we done during our lifetime well well youll see weve written directed and produced i know where im going colonel blimp red shoes do you think that enough sir it is rather obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty with god nature the muse or whatever you may call it when they shot a matter of life and death the fact that other peoples lives would be justified for their deeds could be not apparent to everybody notwithstanding i feel my life would have a meaning had i never done anything else that to see this movieof course oldtimers will be tempted to say they dont do movies like this one any more theyll be partially mistaken they didnt make movies like this in the past times eitherive have already quoted keats here but ill repeat his words a thing of beauty is a joy forever
80,if you fast forward through the horrible singing you will find a classic fairy tale underneath christopher walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role his trademark style of acting works well for the sly puss in boots the other actors are well for their parts i did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward the king in particular appears a real dunce though and i wonder if he is supposed to be i can not remember the original tale the special effects are typical of the eighties but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today overall i recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart
81,this film resembles in many ways enemy of the state with will smith and gene hackman as we have an innocent black man being pursued by the government with all the modern technology known to man usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster that does not apply here of course i love everything david morse does so maybe my comments are not fair but there were more good things about this film then that the main baddy played by doug hutchison was brilliant and the story flowed with excellent extras such as david paymer and robert pastorelli our hero alvin sanders played by jamie foxx was however irritating most of the part he is so out of place cracking bad jokes evoking no sympathy from the audience or not to begin with the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you and on his followers as well i didnt expect much when i rented it but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy bits 710
82,11 oscar nominations and zero win am yet to understand why  its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with halle berry and denzel washington  whoopi oprah margaret avery danny glover etc were all amazing  i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the oscars that year it should go into the shouldawouldacoulda category for the judges its an amazing book  but true to alice walkers style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters  so i am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out the cinematography was amazing  the african scenes live much to be desired  the african part in the book is supposed to be set in liberia  somewhere in west africa  but oh no steven spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of africa outside of the safaris  so yes there had to be a complimentary zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there are none west africa  and most of all why get the people to speak swahili  who in west africa speaks swahili i just had to get that out of the waybut as a story  amazing filmmaking  out of this world  classic yesi own it and i watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation
83,takashi miikes incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements this is a fairy tale that dares to be dark even as a kid i thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales horrible things happen to people in most childrens books miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier and more disturbing than what they appear to be at first glance the filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom he accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with neverending hazardous missions westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids i appreciated the fact that miike was more honest than most american filmmakers he goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain but a selfpossessed miike is still stranger than most filmmakers i thought it was a great film highly recommended
84,if any style of film could be called my guilty pleasure itd be this generic fantasy type guilty is the wrong word for it though as im pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time stardust is good stock fantasy the likes of which one should expect from neil gaiman or gaiman adaptation as it were it isnt the visual dreamscape of mirrormask it isnt the adult pretension of pans labyrinth and it isnt the funloving classic the princess bride but it contains just what the fantasylover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing fantasy lovers should rejoicespecial effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production nowthe story of stardust involves a young man named tristan who in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star to make things difficult however tristans fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine and hes not the only one looking for her some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the stars heart can give and a brothers feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her directionfrom there its all pretty predictable but it involves some attractive fantasy elements some warmhearted commentary on the nature of love and the best part robert deniro as a gay pirate on that note deniros performance is spoton its not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a roughandgruff typecast character thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching deniros own opening up into alternate forms of acting deniro hasnt been so unique to his own image since brazil and thats saying somethingstardust is the type of movie perhaps that will subsist on childrens and fantasylovers shelves for a long time i cant say it offers anything new but its not really there to its actually those most familiar with its tropes that will enjoy it the mostpolarisdib
85,this excellent drama had me in suspense the whole time i could not take my eyes off the screen for one second because every word kept connecting the pieces to this puzzling murder this movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be i really did cry in the end which i dont want to give away it also let me realize how cruel and sickening people can be when it comes to murder the cast was also very good the only bad cast member was the actress who played anne marie the actress did a great job but the director didnt i say this because he found someone who didnt look a single bit like anne marie fahey herself
86,zuthe warriors from magic mountain was and is an impressive classic you never would have guessed it was made in 1983 tsui harks use of special effects was very creative and inventive he continued doing this in the chinese ghost story trilogy and later productions even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre legend of zu is connected to zuwarriors from magic mountain it is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one the plot is a bit hard to follow but to be honest it doesnt matter it is all about the action and adventure i always was wondering what tsui hark would do if he got his hands on cgi now we knowhe made this movie maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not going to be critical about that there is so much happening on the screenyou simply wont believe i think it is a big shame that this movie wasnt shown in theaters here in holland because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like superman returns or xmen 3 the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor in most of tsui harkss movies he combines dramafantasymartial arts and humor somehow it is missing in this movie again i am not going to be picky about these small matters legend of zu delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see a true classic
87,since the day i saw this film when it came out in 1981 it has been one of my top 3 favorites the blurb i wrote for amazon is below and im just thrilled that its finally coming out on dvd on 101706  the films 25th anniversarythe last credit in this film explains its appeal  thank you to the people of manhattan on whose island this was filmed a charming and witty romantic comedy it is a love story written to new yorkers peter bogdanovich is a native who can identify every location west 12th street the ansonia the old fao schwartz the plaza the roxy chez brigitte and city limits which was a country  western club one gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well offscreen as they do on and this intimacy is clearly communicated i laughed i cried it was better than cats not only an ode to dorothy stratten it was also audrey hepburns last feature appearance she had a cameo subsequent to this film and her inner beauty seeps from the screen buy it make a big tub of popcorn and curl up with someone you love
88,my child my sister dream how sweet all things would seem were we in that kind land to live together and there love slow and long there love and die among those scenes that image you that sumptuous weathercharles baudelaire based on the novel by elizabeth von arnim enachanted april can be described in one sentence  it takes place in the early 1920s when four london women four strangers decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april it is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that enchanted april  an ultimate feel good movie is perfection of its genre lovely and sunny tender and peaceful kind and magical it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever this is the movie that actually affected my life i watched it during the difficult times when i was lost unhappy and very lonely when i had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself it helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible i had promised to myself then that no matter what i would pull myself out of misery and selfpity and i would appreciate every minute of life  with its joy and its sadnessi promised myself that i would go to italy and later that year i did and i was not alonecharming enchanting and heartwarming enchanted april is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love this little film is a diamond of highest quality
89,enterprise the latest high budget spinoff to the most successful franchise in film and or television history opens to the tune of a 90minute episode called broken bow first we are swept into a massive action sequence with a klingon being chased by some suliban who are the main enemy in the first season of the show from there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is with some of the best character development story and actionvisual effects ever seen in such a short amount of timethe openingcredits is a debatable subject among the minority of enterprise fans whom some believe that the song is out of place what they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves if one listens to the actual song instead of the theme then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together and eventually as the series progresses further and further and we learn more about our valiant captain and his crew will the song actually become meaningful overall diane warrens theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer russell watsonwhat makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered enterprise is in my opinion one of the most well cast shows since the next generation choosing scott bakula as captain jonathan archer was the best decision since gene himself cast patrick stewart as jeanluc picard as the captain always leads the show bakula adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins he simply is both actor wise and character wise a superb human being and his charm wit and compassion are overwhelming to watch as for the other cast members a favourite of mine is john billingsley who plays dr phlox its also nice to see a nonhuman playing a role and the decision to give the captain a dog named porthos was a wellreceived idea throughout the show character development was brilliant it was fast well timed and almost perfect i say almost because sadly travis mayweathers character played by the briton anthony montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season he does have some things to say here and there but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important jolene blalock is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable subcommander tpol dominic keating as lieutenant malcolm reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer connor trinneer plays commander charles trip tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally linda park as ensign hoshi sato who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting all of these characters make up enterprise and all bring a quality that star trek hasnt seen in a long time each person makes this show worth watching smiles and feelgood senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship enterprise nx01the ship itself the nx01 is somewhat questionable in design the series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before captain kirk so why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships namely the akira class starship continuity has been an issue in enterprise but thankfully rick berman and brannon braga offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details if you see the show with and open mind then youll have no problems but there is an urge to know why all the time so what did berman and braga offer to the star trek fanbase with the issue of the deign of the ship itself according to them the nx01 is how it is because of the incident in first contact when zefram cochrane saw the enterprisee through his telescope and from speaking with the away team lead by commander riker it changed the ideas in his head thats a good enough explanation for melets move on of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer come on guys grow upwhen george lucas destroyed the star wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy fans couldnt do anything only watch and sap it all up anyway and then they learned that well maybe its not that bad after all if you cant accept a quality show for what it is not what it should be in your mind then go elsewhere or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can dothe sets on enterprise remind me very much of the defiant from deep space nine they often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military perhaps that why the crew of the uss enterprise aka flagship of the american fleet like it so much they are striking sets and represent the show perfectlyrick berman the overlord of the empire as john logan so accurately put it and his counterpart brannon braga has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have and in all the right places whether that be technicalities visuals sound editing or score enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be when in the hands of geniuses the late gene roddenberry would be proud of this series and as a star trek fan so should you
90,o my gosh just give me a minute to breath this movie takes you on an awesome ride and doesnt let you go until the very last blow in your face ending this is the the movie for fans of stormriders and such legend of zu was beautifully created although i didnt like a few things they used alot of stand ins i wanted to see the real person fight but oh well a few small let downsand i didnt really like it a lot until i watched it again when you understand it more it totally kicks a i encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true asian movie to see this movie i give this movie one of my highest ratingsgo and see it when it comes out in america
91,turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget the variety of characters is amazing from axewielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls i enjoyed the relationship between the leads not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going i also enjoyed the mix of humour which can be very easy to get wrong too muchnot enough which meant it didnt get too dark nor too spoofy it was a great step up from eaves other efforts hellbreeder and sanitarium in terms of storyline and production they have a great website which is worth checking out cant wait for bane if the level of improvement continues it should be fantastic
92,el mar directed by catalonian director agusti villarona and based on the novel by blai bonet offers a glimpse of the spanish history as seen by a balearic author that takes the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country the movie concentrates on three friends and follows them from those early days during the onset of the war in majorca to a few years later as two of those friends meet again when they are at a sanatorium lost in the countrysidewe first meet three boys that are playing happily not everything is what it seems the tragic death of one of them points out about the cruelty of the one that commits the evil deed the boys have excluded a young girl about their age from taking part in their gameswhen we meet the adult ramallo again he is on his way to a sanatorium he seems to be suffering from tuberculosis to his surprise manuel tur one of his boyhood friends is also being treated and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that supervise their health care it is obvious that tur looks at ramallo in a way that only means he is in love with the tough bully their relationship will have devastating consequencesroger casamajor does a good job with portraying the older ramallo bruno bergonzino makes an impression as tur the vulnerable youth antonia torrens plays sor francisca with conviction angela molina puts an appearance as carmen the wife of the caretaker of the institution simon andreu is perfect as alcantarael mar is a dark film that clearly shows agusti villaronas talents in making the novel come alive for the viewer
93,this is like crouching tiger hidden dragon in a more surreal fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame the plot may be hard to follow but that is the nature of translating chinese folklore to the screen certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience however an intelligent person should be able to keep up moreover the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping cgi
94,this is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life the pacing the camera work the emotion the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see it isnt easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted the only flaw i can see about this film is that it wasnt captured in a more technically perfect film format it deserved toddao technicolor and the very finest sound format availablean intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter the gorgeous italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard as it is it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film i cant stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite the transformations of the characters from contained tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and i really should recommend it more oftenthe casting is perfect the mood is perfect the acting is above reproach it is a film about middle age and the choices people makeit is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you if you dont get it perhaps you havent lived enough or something else is wrong with you
95,i first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it its beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time its difficult to believe this was made in 1946 as the tale is still fresh today and really makes one think im not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made in addition the acting is superb and the use of english and american actors quite astounding i recently purchased the dvd so now im able to watch whenever i wish i highly recommend anyone interested in postwar british films to watch this
96,ned kelly is a wonderfully made australian film honouring a true australian hero we are taken into the world of ned his best friend joe byrne and the other members of the kelly gang as the film explains and perhaps justifies neds actionsthere is an exceptional cast present who all give stellar performances which brings the film to life great job heath orlando bloom was fantastic as joe playing the role of quiet loyal ladiesman very well i was swept up in the moment for a moment i almost believed the gang would win the battle at glenrowan alas it was not to besome aspects of the film are fictional and as an avid ned kelly fan and supporter was slightly disappointed by this perhaps also the film couldve gone longer to cover more of the kelly gangsneds life  i felt not enough was coveredregardless of a few flaws this is a moving film which stirs all sorts of emotions and hey id assume this film would be better to watch rather than mick jagger trying to portray ned
97,he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator in this case portraying attorney and murderer tom capanokathryn morris is sympathetic as victim anne marie fahey but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim we are sorry for the situation but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women including rachel ward as wellthe sad part is where she is actually getting help with her selfesteem issues and capano actually had her psychologist killed pretty hard to believe but this was based on a true storythere is a cameo with olympia dukakis excellent as capanos mother all in all an interesting story because it is based on a true murder and you will want to read ann rules book to get the accurate details 810
98,a wonderful movie anyone growing up in an italian family will definitely see themselves in these characters a good family movie with sadness humor and very good acting from all you will enjoy this movie we need more like it
99,if you are uninitiated to the gundam world this is a good place to start if you are burned out on star wars or star trek here is a compelling realistic scifi series you can become immersed in not the simplistic boysavesworldingiant robot story you might have expected but rather a complex emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the good and bad guys is decidedly less than distinctgundam 0080 focuses on the story of al izuruha a young naive boy living in a neutral space colony he spends his days daydreaming about mobile suits and playing war with his friends during the course of this series al befriends an enemy soldier bernie wiseman by the end little al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrificei loved this oav series with its cool mecha designs involving story and likeable characters i recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic sf anime or to those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment
100,i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering her eyes are the mirror to his soul and what gentle and beautiful eyes they arethose who take things literally will find marleen gorris poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded
101,ive been trying to find out about this series for ages thank you imdb i saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind as a 6year old of course i was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops which was absolutely chilling i talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine which i still have what i also remember though was the atmosphere which was unusual right from the beginning  mysterious austere and extremely authentic when i read the original many years later i experienced that same sensation its a very hard thing to capture  and probably impossible in hollywood every odyssey ive seen since has been an enormous letdown the characters in this series seemed genuine real people  ancient greek people  and not some hollywood stars in costumes this is a real masterpiece but  why is it not better known and why isnt it available on vhs or dvd i would just love to have the chance to see this again
102,think pierce brosnan and you think suave dapper intelligent james bond in this movie brosnan plays against type  and has lots of fun doing so as does the audience this is a film about a hired assassin who befriends a harried businessman and it worksthis is a fun movie with very good scenes a riveting ontheedge brosnan and a good compliant offtheedge kinnear have some good lines my only cavil is that hope davis playing the ohsotolerant wife can i see your gun doesnt appear more often she could have been a marvellous foil to these menthis movie is like a matador it plays with the audience while going for a kill the ending is awesome because a storyline with a positive moral emerges this is a frenetic frantic and fun movie which does deserve a wide audience
103,tsui harks visual artistry is at its peek in this movie unfortunately the terrible acting by ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung i felt the urge to strangle her while watching this its that bad  made it difficult to watch at timesthis movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department when i first saw this my jaw dropped repeatedly and i thought to myself that ive never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of chinese historical kungfu novels without a doubt this is one of the bestlooking chinese historical kungfu epic ever madebut alas tsui hark hasnt improved much in the writing department and the story and dialog are rather juvenile his apparent obsession with the silly and overlylong depiction of the evil guys didnt help either to make it worse this movie is very badly cast they decided to use the hot popular hong kong idols as lead characters but unfortunately both ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung are totally unsuited for historical kungfu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody adam cheng siuchow and brigitte lin in the 1983 version are infinitely betteri wish that someday zhang yimou and tsui hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of tsui but with the maturity and storytelling poetry of zhang
104,910 30 minutes of pure holiday terror okay so its not that scary but it sure is funthe crypt keeper john kassir tales a tale of holiday fear giving us all christmas goose gossebumps that is bwahahahahha you should really be careful what you axe santa for have a scary christmas and a happy new fear okay ill stopokay so in the story a greedy wife best screamer in the world mary ellen trainor kills her husband marshall bell the coach who gets towel whipped to death in anoes 2 for the money but her plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a santa suit larry dr giggles drake comes her wayif you look it up on youtube you can watch it for free but most of you have already seen this my third viewing but if you havent seen it i suggest you do
105,i didnt know what to expect from ned kelly but absolutely loved it it was dark dramatic and gripping it also felt very authentic i felt that i had been transported back to the 1800s ive never been much of a heath ledger fan having only seen him in teen type movies however he is quite compelling in this role ledger plays ned kelly with dignity and intensity showing us how an highly spirited boy became australias most notorious killer naomi watts is great in a supporting role as kellys society lover highly recommended  and thats from an aussie
106,i remember the first time i saw this movie  i was in the office working over the weekend  the tv was on for background noise but i gradually found myself more  more engaged in this movie id never seen or heard of until i was completely absorbed a matter of life  death the british title  stairway to heaven in the us is delightful compelling whimsical  moving all in one superblywritten wellacted perfectlydirected package its a classic that really does rank right up there with casablanca its a wonderful life gone with the wind citizen kane  chariots of fire why has it never received the same public notice  videostore prominence fortunately some knowledgeable critics have put it on their top 100 of all time lists there is hope  1940s fantasia wasnt a hit til the 60s  the wizard of oz was a dud at the box office but made a hit by tv buy it  rent it  watch it  demand it you wont be disappointed
107,i read schneebaums book same title as this film when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of otherness his own and the people of the amazon with whom he lived and loved to a way of living a decent life his subsequent books were not as powerful but showed his continuing quest his description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60s but his honesty and openness about it were welcome this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence which is not a morally positive term in this case that occurs when civilized men intrude on traditional societies even so schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness
108,and i love it lots of special effects and for a movie thats not made on mega budget this movie really does great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece im one of the guys who didnt understand the story at all but this was still a great flick to watch its definitely up there in standards surpassing bored of the rings and on par with movies like harry potter which is saying a lot for a movie again made on a fraction of the budget of these international hitsone thing i really love about this movie is that it so stretches the envelope of adventure movie to come out of hong kong the topic is exotic and original production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of hk for fantasy action movie and acting is greatone of the best movies to come out of hong kong this is the infernal affairs of hong kong fantasy movie and i hope theyll continue working in this area until they surpass hollywood adventure moviesjust fantastic
109,this story was never among my favourites in christies works so i was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation the mouse motif was effective if a little overdone the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the crime in the past subplot the students were all pretty much as i imagined them although its a pity they werent a more cosmopolitan bunch  perhaps the revised thirties setting didnt allow for that i thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming perhaps its because ive not long reread the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early onhumour was much more prevalent in these early poirots sometimes it works but i found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode though i did smile at the lemon sole throwaway line altogether though a solid entry in the series though not one of the best
110,joan crawford had just begun her working girl makes good phase with the dynamic paid 1930 she had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed so while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering because they were clinging to characters that had been the in thing a few years before but were now becoming passe joan was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress the depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon of course if you became rich through immoral means but suffered for it  that was alrightthis film starts out with a spectacular house boat party bonnie jordan joan crawford is the most popular girl there  especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear however when bonnies father has a heart attack because of loses on the stock market both bonnie and her brother rodney william bakewell realise who their real friends are after bob townsend lester vail  a poor mans johnny mack brown offers to do the right thing and marry her  they had just spent a night together when bonnie declared with abandon that she wants love on approval  she starts to show some character by deciding to get a jobshe finds a job at a newspaper and quickly impresses by her will to do well her working buddy is bert scranton cliff edwards and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob rodney also surprises her with the news that he also has a job she is thrilled for him but soon realises it is bootlegging and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer jake luva clark gable rodney witnesses a mass shooting and goes to pieces spilling the beans to the first person he sees drinking at the bar  which happens to be bert he is then forced to kill bert and after wards he goes into hiding the paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find berts killer and sends bonnie undercover as a dancer in one of jakes clubs joan does a very lively dance to accordian joe  much to sylvies disgust the film ends with a gun battle and as rodney lies dying bonnie tearfully phones in her storythis is a super film with crawford and gable giving it their all natalie moorehead who as sylvie shared a famous cigarette scene with gable early in the film was a stylish other woman who had her vogue in the early thirties william bakewell had a huge career he had started as a teenager in a douglas fairbanks film in the mid 20s a lot of his roles though were weak spineless characters in this film he played the weak brother and was completely overshadowed by joan crawford and the dynamic newcomer clark gable  maybe that was why he never became a starhighly recommended
111,the true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way note that this change need not be positive or beneficial at the endby that measure enchanted april is a resounding success as a film in general it succeeds quite wellexcellent ensemble cast welldeveloped characters you come to care about wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations in short the film is well enchanting although all the performances are firstrate three must be mentionedjosie lawrence jim broadbent and joan plowright it says something when miranda richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast most highly recommended particularly if you are a romantic at heart further deponent saith not
112,dance fools dance is an early crawfordgable vehicle from 1931 crawford plays a bonnie jordan a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties booze and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go swimming this all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother william blakewell penniless bonnie gets a job on a newspaper using the name mary smith her brother goes to work for bootleggers the head man is jake luva  portrayed by clark gable as he plays yet another crook later of course he would turn into a romantic hero but in the early 30s mgm used him as a bad guy not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity bonnie cozies up to luvagable and crawford made a great team her facial expressions are a little on the wild side but that along with her dancing is one of the things that makes the movie fun look for cliff edwards the voice of jiminy cricket as bertits always interesting to see the precode movies and dance fools dance is no exception
113,father of the pride is a pleasant surprise it is funny witty and features some great voice acting the show is about the family of a lion who is acting as the attraction of siegfried  roy shows indeed all of them are stereotypes but thats what makes them so funny fotp is not a kiddiecartoon it includes some crude adult humor but in a very mild way it is full of popculture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed id say ill give the show a 7 out of ten because it is nice fairly well executed but not very original ive seen most of those stereotypes many times before even in that particular order
114,i had seen marion davies in a couple of movies and really couldnt understand her appeal she couldnt dance for peanuts she didnt attempt to sing and as for her acting  she seemed in a trance but i hadnt seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful rather than kidding her own image as has been suggested here to me it seems a satire on gloria swanson who did start off in slapstick comedies went on to highly emotional womens pictures and did end up marrying a count marion a top mimic also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand that was gloria swanson spot oncolonel pepper dell henderson has motored all the way from georgia to hollywood determined to prove that his daughter peggy marion davies will be the greatest star ever their hope dwindles and they are down to their last 40 cents when they meet billy boone william haines who works at the slapstick studios and promises to get peggy a job peggy thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic they convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success charlie chaplin asks for her autograph but she doesnt recognise him and treats him pretty rudely who was that short little guy  when she finds out she faints peggy and billy get a call from high art studio but only peggy is wanted and suddenly she is on her way there is a funny scene where she sees a star she doesnt think much of  its marion daviesshe finally gets a chance of being a dramatic actress  but she cant cry it is a hilarious scene as the director tries everything to get her to cry and when he succeeds she cant stop her new leading man andre paul ralli convinces her to forget her comedy past and become elite and sophisticated  she even adopts a new name  patricia pepoire she also seems to have forgotten billy and her dad  she has developed a star personality when the slapstick studio picks the same location as patricias movie billy is thrilled to see her but quite unprepared for her snobby attitude when she calls him a cheap clown he realises that she is not the girl he once knew after a studio luncheon  a magnificent panning shot of some of the greatest stars of the day patricia gets a call from the boss it seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them  the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old peggy back she and andre decide to get married she dreams of being a countess even though billy says that andre used to serve him spaghetti in a little cafe downtown and is no more a count than he is on her wedding day billy visits and after a hilarious custard pie fight she realises that billy is the one for herit was amazing to see all the guest stars  john gilbert is seen going through the mgm gates lew cody is talking to elinor glynn who not only wrote it but several racy romances that were made into mgm movies william haines another actor whose movies i had always wanted to see was great  especially in the cafeteria scene  he had wonderful comic timing harry gribbon was hilarious as the comedy director  there were so many hilarious scenes in this film and marion was at the top of them all  im giving this film 10 out of 10highly highly recommended
115,robert duvall is a direct descendent of confederate general robert e lee according the imdbcom movie database after seeing this film you may think duvalls appearance is reincarnation at its best one of my most favorite films i wish the composer peter rodgers melnick had a cd or there was a soundtrack available wonderful scenery and music and all tootruetolife especially for those of us that live in or have moved to the south this is a real moment in time life moves on slowly but strangers we do not remain
116,this film was just brilliantcastinglocation scenerystorydirectioneveryones really suited the part they playedand you could just imagine being thererobert redfords is an amazing actor and now the same being directornormans father came from the same scottish island as myselfso i loved the fact there was a real connection with this filmthe witty remarks throughout the film were greatit was just brilliantso much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watchand the flyfishing was amazingreally cried at the end it was so sadand you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been goodand this definitely was also congratulations to the two little boys that played the parts of norman and paul they were just brilliantchildren are often left out of the praising list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole filmbut these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done dont you think the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someones life after all that was shared with us all
117,i loved dedee pfeiffer is that spelled right in cybil havent seen her for awhile and forgot how much i missed her i thought she did a great job in this the supporting cast was pretty good too in some angles the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman the abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists the young boyfriend was a hottie i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for surejust got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movies kept my interest and ill watch it again when they rerun it can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this you can post on the board or send me a private email if you want thanks in advance aboutagirly
118,perhaps the funniest backstage at hollywood movie ever especially for a look at comedy short factories like keystonemarion davies should get a medal for bravery for taking a part where acting poorly in front of a camera is part of the role plenty of cameos for film buffs
119,wow so much fun probably a bit much for normal american kids and really its a stretch to call this a kids film this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits  very terry gilliam all the way through while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuelesquire moments the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kidhero with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miikes work the layers of meaning and metaphor particularly the antiwar  antirevenge message of human folly is pretty damn poignant as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films only instead of over the top torture and gore he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folklore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multifaceted adventure fn rad and one of miikes best
120,the matador is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it it seems so light the humor is always mediumgauge never unfunny but never gutbusting the story is a very simple thread the characteristics of the plot are often recycled features namely the unscrupulous bad guy in need of a pal and the straightlaced glasswearing good guy in need of security in life team up and learn from each other and somehow complement each others lifestyles i also find the bullfighting parallel to the story unnecessary as it is a simply cruel thing and the symbolism is hardly potent enough to carry itself however it really is a good film because though it seemed so thin and unaffecting at the time it wasnt it has a subtle way of connecting with the audiencei believe the reason it slowly but surely gives the audience something to take with them is because though its a formula that is nothing new even most of the humor both main characters virtually the only characters in it are somehow met and gotten to know forget calling them real thats not at all what i mean what i mean is that though pierce brosnans filthy womanizing boozing hit man is a detached comical character hes grasped firmly by the writer and definitely by brosnan who is aggressively communicating how much he enjoys his breath of fresh james bondless air greg kinnears character seems quite the same in his detached scriptedness but hes given certain very unexpected footnotes that for a moment due to the films lightfootedness pass us by but then hit us only a moment later we then realize the film is not simply analyze this or planes trains and automobiles told stalely over again its truly saying somethingthe films climax is of a sort that wants to partially be a thriller with twists but with its lightness how can that possibly be the focus of the film though the plot has been leading up to it no the focus is what brosnan and kinnear get out of their unlikely relationship to each other strangely the matador is a film about regret and loneliness brosnan deals with loneliness and regret every day and though we dont understand why kinnear is so lenient and accepting with brosnan continually interrupting his life its slowly understood that brosnan is salvaging kinnear from a more downtoearth version of his own feelings as a means of redemption the very last scene of the movie stays with me it i think is where the films subtle sidestepping impact finally begins to seep
121,let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of startrek at least twice i do not consider myself a trekker or trekkie those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors the acting was better than average but the plot held no surprises they tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation now as to the historical errors if you call them that the first capitan to pilot the enterprise was commander april then capt pike jim kirk etc according to a statement made by both riker and kirk we dicovered the klingons and educated them and gave them the technology thats the reason a prime directive was created but like i said these are no reason to discredit this fine series i hope the plots will get deeper and then special effects can take a backseat
122,i love this movie because i grew up around harness racing pat boone behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because unlike thoroughbred jockeys men of normal height and weight can be drivers yes the 1944 home in indiana is a better movie but its also a very different movie april love is light and easy to watch a feel good movie disappointing though that pat boones religiousmoral views prohibited him from ever kissing the girl quite a change from todays standard fare home in indiana with walter brennan filmed in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever burst into song captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying but it requires a bigger emotional investment
123,being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities i think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdbits your basic who done it thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the standardto me it was worth watching more than once so ill give it an 8 on imdb
124,when i was a kid i watched this many times over and i remember whistling the happy cat song quite often all the songs are great and actually memorable unlike many childrens musicals where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason the scenes and costumes are lavish and the acting is very welldone which isnt surprising considering the cast christopher walken is very catlike and doesnt need stupid makeup or a cat costume for the viewer to believe hes a cat transformed to a human and jason connerys so cute as the shy and awkward millers son corin who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera this is a really fun enjoyable featurelength movie where unlike most fairytales the characters are given personalities some of my favourite parts are when puss makes corin pretend hes drowning at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance as its all the rage abroad when walken is in the kitchen dancing on the table hes a pretty good dancer too and when vera tells corin all the things she used to do when she was young like pretending she was a millers daughter id recommend this film to children and parents alike who love magic and fairytales and it actually is a movie you can watch together as it wont drive adults up the wall
125,the great and underrated marion davies shows her stuff in this late 1928 silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines they appear in cheap comedies until marion is discovered and becomes a big dramatic star a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretentions davies  haines are a wonderful team too bad they never made a talkie together and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart john gilbert elinor glynn and marion davies you have to see it are a hoot a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the stillmaligned marion davies
126,this is such a fantastic movie a western about a selfconcerned man jimmy stewart going up to the klondike for gold on the way he gets hassled by a local sheriff in alaska john mcintire giving a wonderfully evil performance whom he hassles back mcintire threatens that hell be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town which is unfortunately the only way back to the states the main chunk of the story is about the peaceful klondike town of dawson being turned upside down by new residents from mcintires town ruth roman for instance who has come with stewart and his two companions jay c flippen and walter brennen who plays stewarts best friend builds a saloon a hollywood front for a whorehouse and tries to run the towns restaurant and hangout place out of business she paves the way for mcintire and his goons to come up too in 1953 jimmy stewart and director anthony mann made one of the peaks of the western genre the naked spur the far country is just the tiniest bit less and it contains 999 of what made that film so special without of course feeling like a cheap copy like the naked spur the far country boasts beautiful onlocation cinematography the landscape is gorgeous stewart gives one of his best performances nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954 rear window i suppose it could be considered cliche as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end still stewart plays it so damn well he makes this character very human and the supporting performances are universally fantastic in addition to those ive mentioned the adorable french actress corinne calvet is very good and i ought to single out walter brennen as well he seems to have specialized in playing best friends his relationship with stewart is very touching since he is at first the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man the screenplay is very well written and manns direction is impeccable a masterpiece 1010
127,when i first saw this film on cable it instantly became one of my favorite movies im a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes most of the attitudes came from soll an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor soll is what makes the move his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way the south was back then i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimers disease none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex while he has racist views hes grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black the two convicts he trusts most are jacksonmel winkler and benjames earl jones the conversations between ben and soll are the best in the movie they have real chemistry james earl jones and mel winkler both but in great performances as well as hassthis movie should have gotten more notoriety however its on dvd and worth the moneyrayvyn
128,they all laughed is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why their are many reasons the fact that its set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from ben gazzara and the late john ritter who is superb and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novakthe films coproducer and john ritter basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnates wifehepburn and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans
129,im biased towards any movie that paints a luxuriant picture of italy  in my opinion the most romantic country in the world unfortunately the movie was rather short unusually so for a period piece and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect however the excellent story makes up for it the four ladies embark on a muchneeded relaxing vacation with problems on their minds over the course of the movie they realize their problems and begin fixing them they believe san salvatore the castle they stay in has an enchanting effect on people its a tub of love says lottie wilkins you can watch their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant as the italian seaside works its magic on themall their problems and their solutions are plausible the actresses were great the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale all in all a 1010 movie for me
130,1928 is in many ways a lost year in motion pictures just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre sound was coming in and  while reaping great profits at the box office  was setting the art of filmmaking back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technologyshow people is one of the great silent era comedies the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him learns his lesson and then redeems himself by winning the football game the polo game etc this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no susan alexander kane she had excellent comic instincts and timing this film starts out as the beverly hillbillieslike adventure of peggy pepper marion davies and her father general marmaduke oldfish pepper fresh from the old south general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress while at the studio commissary the peppers run into billy boone william haines a slapstick comedian he gets peggy an acting job shes unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick but she perseveres eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles soon the newfound fame goes to her head and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man whom she doesnt really love unless fate somehow intervenesone of the things mgm frequently does in its late silentera films and in its early soundera films is feature shots of how filmmaking was done at mgm circa 1930 this film is one of those as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggys autograph an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesnt care for her truly a delight from start to finish this is a silent that is definitely worth your while this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible
131,what can i add that the previous comments havent already said this is a great film and the light sabre duel star wars tribute has to be seen to be believed there are moments of genius throughout this movie if you can see it now thanks again to rick baker who gave me this movie many years ago
132,the latest film by the spanish director agusti villaronga is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a maleprostitute villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in spain under franco the three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosisthe cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow spaniard pedro almodovars work with themes dealing with sexual desire both heterosexual and homosexual an element that is different between the two directors is that villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic gritty realism opposed to almodovars use of surrealism although both styles are similarthe piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature i highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing
133,i am a huge john denver fan i have a large collection of his music on vinyl i saw this christmas special when it was originally on tv and loved it i have the original vinyl album and cd i have the original cd and later release the later release is missing several songs though i see that it has been released this year with all original songs to my surprise i found the original cd for sale at 7500 wow  to think that a christmas cd would be worth that much to me no amount is worth selling this treasure it is my favorite christmas cd i have never been able to find it on vhs or dvd i would love to have either version if anyone has one available please let me know thanks
134,well i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was funny and sad and yes the guy andie macdowell shagged was hot interesting realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery i think my mum would like it i still think they should have been allowed to call it the sad fkers club though
135,it breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be its very underrated people forgot what movies are really about nowadays they only think about bum bum movies which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends like transformers movies which are oriented with hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline its the kind of a movie what i despite most of course it is fun watching greatly made cgis but we do not gain anything essential from that kind of moviesi honestly think that performance was excellent especially busy philipps alongside with erika christensen and victor garberwhom i respect made this movie an oscar worth emotional performance by busy philipps was astonishing its such a shame we wont see oscar in her hands which she deserves
136,i love this movie director michael powell once stated that this was his favorite movie and it is mine as well powell and pressburger created a seemingly simple superbly crafted story  the power of love against the powers that be however its deception lies in the complexity of its is it real or is it imaginary premise basically one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young poetically inclined airman during wwii or is it the question is never answered one way or the other actually it is never even asked this continuous understatement is part of the films appealthe innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers for instance pressburger always wanted to do a cinematic version of richard strauss opera der rosenkavalier about a young 18th century viennese aristocrat this is evident in the brief interlude in which conductor 71 dressed in all his finery holds the rose which appears silver in heaven the music even has a dreamy qualityall of the acting is first rate  david niven is at his most charming and he has excellent support from veteran roger livesey and relative newcomer kim hunter but in my opinion the films charm comes from marius goring as conductor 71 he by far has the most interesting role filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness brightening the film its a pity that some of conductor 71s scenes were left on the cutting room floor it is also a pity that gorings comedic talents are rarely seen again on film except in the wonderful videos of the scarlet pimpernel television series from the 1950s this is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career he is a perfect foil for relaxed style of niven and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters ironically also in the mid 1940s niven also starred against another heavenly messenger played by cary grant in the bishops wife their acting styles were so similar that i found the result boring unenergetic and disappointing as a note according to powell goring desperately wanted the role of peter carter initially refusing conductor 71 its a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayalthe movie commissioned to smooth over the strained relations between britain and the us overdrives its point towards the end but it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war  the numerous casualties both military and civilian the need to go on when faced with death there is a conspicuous lack of wwii enemies in heaven but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin powell and pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it wasnt necessary the movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the atlantic
137,i grew up watching this series i was about seveneight years old when it was on i still remember the 1st episode which was called the new house it scared the hll out of me i can almost still hear that statue laughing madly and the ending oh my god the hooror spirit comes in the room for the child yikes this was classic tv and it was a one of a kind series i have found a dvd collection for sale on the internet 2 actually my question to any readers has anyone purchased this set its a bootleg both sellers claim to have very good copy i have a sketchy and poor dvd of the new house episode and a couple of other episodes that are a bit betterhowever if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids a great series clever scary and daringly supernatural thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this in fact id love to discuss it chris walker
138,in the year 1985 my birth year steven spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young africanamerican girl celie debut role for whoopi goldberg whose life is followed through rough times the story begins from the year 1909 when celie is only 14 years old she has given birth two children for her father celie has a younger sister nettie with whom she is inseparable a widower lays his eyes on nettie but their father gives celie to him it is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling women are inferior of men and especially being an africanamerican woman their rights are less than a zero celies story is a true survival storythe color purple is a masterpiece and underestimated film of spielberg he should make more drama which the color purple and schindlers list are good notionthe cast is amazing whoopi goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama danny glover was surprisingly nasty mister i have never seen him in a such an evil role the talkshow icon oprah winfrey is brilliant as a strongwilled sofiawarning prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film you can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like i have with my sisterbig applauds to mr spielberg
139,this is one of those rare movies its lovely and compelling dignified and quirky a true gift i consider it a prerequisite for any trip to italy or any vacation at all because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience yup find the magic i especially loved josie lawrence as lottie wilkins but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film further the costumes if youre drawn to fashion and costumes are extraordinarily well done i just wish theyd release it on dvd because im wearing my tape version out absolutely well worth your time just make sure to settle in to watch it without any interruptions
140,the last wave is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind the title refers to the aboriginal doomsday theory there will be one last wave that wipes out everythingdavid burton richard chamberlain is a sydney lawyer hired to defend some aborigines accused of murder around this time there has been unusually heavy rainfall in australia while defending the aborigines david learns the last wave theory and begins to wonder whether its just mythologythe movies last sequence is a metaphor for descending into the depths of ones mind peter weir created a perplexing but thoughtprovoking movie aboriginal actor david gulpilil whom you may have seen in walkabout crocodile dundee and rabbitproof fence provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendantsif you get a chance watch the making of feature on the dvd peter weir explains some of the films undertones some of which relate to richard chamberlains background
141,for me too this christmas special is one that i remember very fondly in 1989 i snatched up the 2 cds i found of the soundtrack recording giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself its part of my familys christmas tradition now and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i listenit has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show and they did more than one special together the good rapport between denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages
142,okay the recent history of star trek has not been good the next generation faded in its last few seasons ds9 boldly stayed where no one had stayed before and voyager started very bad and never really lived up to its promise so when they announced a new star trek series i did not have high expectations and the first episode broken bow did have some problems but overall it was solid trek material and a good rompill get the nits out of the way first the opening theme is dull and i dont look forward to sitting through it regularly but thats what remotes are for what was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room they need to cut that nonsense outbut the plot was strong and moved along well the characters though still new seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect the vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before with a slightly ominous theme i particularly liked the linguist who is the first star trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears they seemed to stay true to trek lore something that has been a significant problem in past series though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields the instant invention of technology that can fix anything and the inevitable plethora of timetravel stories anyone want to start a pool on how long before the borg show upall in all the series has enormous potential they are seeing the universe with fresh eyes we have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series how did the klingons go from just insulting to war how did we meet the romulans how did the federation form and just who put earth in charge why is the prime directive so important if they address these things rather than spitting out time travel episodes this will be an interesting seriesmy favorite line zephram cochran saying where no man has gone before not no one
143,to be honest i had no idea what this movie was about when i started it thats how i watch movies whenever possible no preconception i thought this was going to be a movie about stoners in the woods or something i was wrong kindaloaded was kind of boring at first but once it started to get going it really hooked me i know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but to do things that you do not want to doanother user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but i beg to differ these kinds of things do happen im sorry but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are implausible really sorry but the reality of the world is that they do happen the creator of this movie as well as the actors did a great job of portraying how things can just go bad and how people can make really bad choices sometimes things turn out good sometimes they turn out bad and such is lifei highly recommend this movie
144,i am black american and i loved this soap opera i watched it dubbed in spanish on telemundo almost 57 years ago the story was a true story about a black slave whos love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and candid whimsical way of livinga lot of us could learn a lot from xica she took what she had nothing and saw her possibilities many would argue that she sold herself out  but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future childrenit was such an excellent soap opera that i thought it would be released on dvd but its not being released this soap opera was the best soap opera ever we need for it to be released on dvd or broadcast on tv again its playing on azteca america right now which is only available in mexico or in the us by paid cable we need it released again to telemundo
145,i like many horror fans have been force fed the same banal big budget hollywood remakes and mtv high school slasher tripe for the last 20 years here at last is an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right boxesyou want a hot lead actress you want vampires you want cool weapons you want cool vehicles and you want blood lots of it by the bucket load  you got itwith excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the hammer horror scream queen herself stephanie beacham this really is fantastic stuffdespite its low budget by opting to use 35 mm stock and adding quality cg effects to the mix director james eaves has created something that feels much biggera must for old school horror fans
146,if saura hadnt done anything like this before iberia would be a milestone now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of spanish culture but he has done a lot like this before and though we can applaud the riches he has given us we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include blood wedding 1981 carmen 1983 el amore brujo 1986 sevillanas 1992 salomé 2002 and tango 1998 i would choose sauras 1995 flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document next to which iberia palesiberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of isaac manuel francisco albéniz 18601909 and in particular his iberia suite for piano isaac albéniz was a great contributor to the externalization of spanish musical culture  its reformatting for a nonspanish audience he moved to france in his early thirties and was influenced by french composers his iberia suite is an imaginative synthesis of spanish folk music with the styles of liszt dukas and dindy he traveled around performing his compositions which are a kind of beautiful standardization of spanish rhythms and melodies not as homogenized as ravels bolero but moving in that direction naturally the spanish have repossessed albéniz and in iberia the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles but the source is a tamed and diluted form of spanish musical and dance culture compared to the echt spanishness of pure flamenco flamenco coming out of the region of andalusia is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane hispanoarabic and jewish cultures iberia simply is the peninsula comprising spain portugal andorra and gibraltar the very concept is more diluted sauras flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music singing dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of spanish style the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache  even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it  in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion they just are saura always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer antonio gades and other artists in his 1995 flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers musicians and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens flats and mirrors arranged by cinematographer vittorio storaro another of the spanish filmmakers important collaborators the beginnings and endings of sequences in flamenco are often rough but atmospheric marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over sigh or laugh or somebody just unexpectedly says something in flamenco more than any of sauras other musical films its the rapt intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olés that is the story and creates the magic because saura has truly made magic and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional storyiberia is in a similar style to some of sauras purest musical films no narration no dialogue only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region beginning with a pianist playing albenizs music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing in flamenco music the fundamental element is the unaccompanied voice and that voice is the most unmistakable and unique contribution to world music it relates to other songs in other ethnicities but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique uglybeautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention then comes the clapping and the foot stomping and then the dancing combined with the other elements there is only one flamenco song in iberia if you love sauras flamenco youll want to see iberia but youll be a bit disappointed the style is there some of the great voices and dancing and music are there but iberias source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience
147,this is a really interesting movie it is an action movie with comedy mixed in foxx teams up with comedian epps in this movie to give it a comedic spin it will keep you wondering whats going to happen to foxx next it was a well shot movie the director used the right colors in this moviedark blue colors to give it the right kind of feel kimberly elise also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen she plays her role well even jamie kennedy is in this movie its worth seeing it you havent seen it its definitely worth having if you are a jamie foxx fan it deserves more credit than it is actually given
148,first let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots i really enjoyed them i really enjoyed this movie but i got to say next to pierce brosnan greg kinear is pretty lackluster brosnan melts into this character so well that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond it also shows his range and depth as an actor it is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year i found the characters to be well crafted the twist in the middle i felt was especially good i also liked how the characters come off realistically so many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walkingstereotypes i like the different approaches this movie takes i think of sideways when i think of this movie but i think this is more watchable and a better movie overall
149,this movie has wild bill hickok calamity jane buffalo bill and general custer all together gary cooper plays wild bill and jean arthur plays calamity jane and charles bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the indians and you can hardly recognize him this was the first time cecil b demille and gary cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time this movie starts out with lincolns assassination and it also deals with an indian war calamity jane is in love with wild bill and buffalo bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home this movie also deals with custers last stand and is far from accurate gary cooper is good as usual and i usually dont like jean arthur but i liked her here
150,ive seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time i still felt itthe story itself was incredible but came alive by spielbergs expertise and the fabulous cast including whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey danny glover and margaret avery akosua busia deserved an oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of nettieyoull experience every human emotion while watching this film i laughed cried and got angry like most great movies it was looked over by the academy with a host of nominations but no wins but this movie without a doubt is definitely one of the best films of all time
151,surprisingly well done for an independent film an insomniacs nightmare paints a startling picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia wonderfully well written and directed it creates the atmosphere of a dream as the viewer is taken through one night in the life of an insomniacstarring dominic monaghan as jack we get to see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night drag on the narration is almost hypnotizing and from the opening lines it is impossible to turn away fascinating and slightly disturbing it shows how someone copes with a lack of sleep balancing on the brink between sanity and madnesswith twists and turns around every corner an insomniacs nightmare is provocative and engaging it comes very highly recommended
152,this is probably one of the most original love stories i have seen for ages especially for a war based briefly film basically it is a story based in two worlds one obviously real the other fictitious but the filmmakers say at the beginning that it is only coincidence if it is a real place anyway peter carter the great david niven was going to crash in a plane he talked to june planet of the apes kim hunter before he bailed out and said he loved her he was meant to die from jumping without a parachute but somehow he survived and now he is seeing and loving june in the flesh this other place like a heaven is unhappy because he survived and was meant to come to their world so they send french conductor 71 marius goring to persuade him to go but he is obviously in love peter suggests to him that he should appeal to keep his life to the other worlds court he is granted this obviously love prevails when the two lovers announce that they would die for each other june even offers to take his place also starring robert coote as bob trubshawe kathleen byron as an angel a brief then unknown lord sir richard attenborough as an english pilot and abraham sofaer as the judgethe surgeon david niven was number 36 on the 50 greatest british actors the film was number 86 on the 100 greatest tearjerkers for the happy ending it was number 47 on the 100 greatest war films it was number 46 on the 50 greatest british films and it was number 59 on the 100 greatest films outstanding
153,i have to say seventeen  missing is much better than i expected the perception i took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but i was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mysterydedee pfeiffer is emilie a mom who insists her daughter lori tegan moss not attend a socalled graduation party one weeknight but lori ignores her mothers wishes and takes off for the party anyway when lori does not come home emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearanceseventeen  missing is better than so many other tv movies of this type as it is not so predictable pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie and most of it comes off as believable this lmn original movie premiered last night 1010
154,i remember seeing this in a the salem movie theater where i used to attend kiddie matinées almost every saturday in dayton ohio when i was a young boy and have never forgotten it it simply amazed me and my friends i do wish there were some way i could see it again i have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail i only recently discovered that it was a cousteau film and that blew my mind even more how the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding the fish is actually in the cats mouth at one point if i remember correctly if anyone could help me find a way to see it again i would be extremely grateful
155,heres a fun fact i was the baby in the movie the one in the crib  i am 19 years old now my parents took me to try out for the part we lived in texas at the timei think i only made like 80 bucks for it but i wasnt in it very long my parents said i would cry when i was supposed to be happy and would be happy when i was supposed to cry i was all mixed up strange and funny fact i suppose and no i am not a child actress i am livin in san antonio workin at a walgreens i graduated here in texas but i lived in maryland most my life this movie is a great movie though good concept i have seen it several times in my short 19 years
156,interesting characters lots of tension as close to black and white without being black and white i was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character a quiet near deaf secretary was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own getaway im a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury theyve done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks in this film we never know whos money it really is they abscond with or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deafsecretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot too bad the film could have been great
157,the color purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps those people strongly affected by the struggles of life every character had an element of the color purple in them the movie touches on love lost hope hate and triumph whether it be celie having lived through hell and losing her sister and shug coming into her life to show her love again albert not being man righting his wrong toward celie shug shunned by her father and confesses to him in the end sofia and her stubborness good and bad and even nettie they had their emptiness and hardship through the film but was overcome in the end and thats the sign of a good movie good job to all the cast and crew
158,legend of zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years it transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art with unmatched visual sceneries and story of divine proportions legend of zu proceeds to blow over its viewers with its majesty this movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life the acting is perfect for this type of movie if you were an immortal with supernatural powers i would think youd keep more to yourselfunlike the comments of many the plot is actually quite easy to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency anyone that cannot keep track of the different characters simply must not be paying attention since or are used to such levels of sophistication as the titanic the plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you gasping for air legend of zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put off by its grandeur allow yourself to be completely engulfed within its fantastical vision and you will grow to love this movie
159,how could i possibly pass up the chance to see orlando bloom and heath ledger together well i couldnt and so i rented this mess of a moviei had never heard of ned kelly and was surprised by what i found out about this young mans legend i was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was perhaps the fact that it was very very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow i found this story difficult to follow not because the story is complicated but because it is slow even with a slow story ledger and bloom managed to create interesting dimensional characters though i flounder to recommend this as a must see it is a great story of australian history considering how young the country is this is very rare and should be appreciated and the film does have some good actions sequences 610 see it for historical valueyeah rightand thats the only reason to see it  
160,the neil simons sunshine boys starring walter matthau and george burns is a funny comedy on the strange bond to the life and its shortness but the laughter always bitter taste seeing willy clarkmatthau and al lewisburns two big theatrical comedy actors now reduced on the imbecility from the hard and unceasing old age you can feel only anger and blue willy not ever surrender and continue to look work while al is tired for players and he is retired to the country in the house to his daughter the couple in his old time was truly funny and harmony but out the scene was a continue squabble and to quarrel and for eleven years after their broken they not talk between now if they would work they must return together another time for do one of his best old sketch for a comedy story tv show the meets is explosive and liberating for the old questions the neil simons screenplay give a certain corrosive spirit to the story and the melancholy and blue overwhelming the many gags and laughter succeeded to generate a good mix also thanks to a great couple walter matthunomination academy award as best actor and george burnswon the academy award as best support actor the two actors are very believable and real and the their harmony seems almost as they real work together for all that time and that realty they not bear between them the movie is very touching also for its all consuming reality as the story is narrate and how the report loveheat that bind the two actors is totally real part to the strange but at the same time ordinarily comprehensible things to the life my rate is 7
161,broken bow takes us back to where it all began set 150 years in our future and 100 years before kirk spock and mccoy this installment of the star trek franchise is in my opinion the first series since tos to recapture the feelings of wonder danger and excitement of going where no man has gone before scott bakula is perfectly cast as jonathan archer the first captain of the first star ship enterprise he and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the star trek legacy john billingsley is brilliant as the alien dr phlox and jolene blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical vulcan science officer tpol broken bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the treks and i believe gene roddenberry would surely be proud
162,i remember when this film was up for the academy awards and did not win in any category for the life of me i cannot remember what it was up against but one thing i can say it was one of the best movies i have ever seen and the fact that steven spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bitessentially it is about a black womans trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman there are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with along the way we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption whoopi goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie danny glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film and the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely not like some sideshow freak shows like the more recent beloved did i encourage anyone of any race to see this film 910
163,my only minor quibble with the film i grew up knowing as stairway to heaven is the fact that the wonderful raymond massey is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene and the trial itself imo is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasydavid niven and kim hunter are wonderfully cast as the young lovers but its roger livesey who gives the liveliest and most credible performance french accented marius goring is a delight he even gets in a remark about technicolor as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relishseeing this tonight on tcm for the first time in twenty or so years i think its a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for films the technicolor photography somewhat subdued and not garish at all is excellent and the way it shifts into bw for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectivenessthe opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the storyand nivens tense talk with radio operator hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter truly a marvelous film from beginning to end another triumph for michael powell and emeric pressburger
164,i guess if a film has magic i dont need it to be fluid or seamless it can skip background information go too fast in some places too slow in others etc magic in this film the scene in the library there are many minor flaws in stanley  iris yet they dont detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible the hardest to fix both characters are smart yet stanley cant understand enough to function because he cant read he cant read because hes had too much adventure in his childhood iris although welleducated hasnt had enough adventure and so cant understand how to move past the uturn her life took in both their faults and strengths the characters compliment each other it may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an iris would wind up working year after year in a factory or that a stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other betterpaying job and while these mysteries are explained in the course of the story their unfolding seems somewhat contrived i assume no one took the time to rethink the script even so its a good moviejust imagine what de niro fonda and plimpton would have done on screen if someone had
165,this made for television version of the legendary stand against hopeless odds is more objective more realistic than earlier filmed versions of the events though the one movie made after this went perhaps too far in humanizing the figures of sam houston bowie travis and crockettthe focus here is on jim bowie played with sharp cynical detachment by james arness who is apparently still alive at age 85 then 65 he made a comeback to acting after years away from the screen to do this partpuerto ricanborn raul julia humanizes gen santa ana as no one since j carol naish back in 54 had done however the mexican dictator is portrayed as a lecherous vainglorious popinjaygaudier uniforms have never been seen before or since he receives excellent advice from the european officers he has hired but convinced of his own infallibility he does not heed italec baldwin is the one actor whose age is appropriate to the character he plays col william travis his portrayal is earnest he is almost in awe of the older men who share command with himthe one jarring note was brian keith as crockett in a coonskin cap and carrying ol betsy he stumbles about as if he had wandered in from another movie with no conviction in the portrayal the character is reduced to a few stage conventions the script reveals some historical facts overlooked or suppressed in earlier film versions we learn that jim bowie was in the person of santa ana fighting his own brotherinlaw the mexican soldiers performed poorly in part because they were armed with rifles left over from the napoleonic wars a generation earlier santa ana likes a bargain bowie wryly explains the whole project of defending the former spanish mission as a fort was militarily ill adviseda fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film the alamo
166,i saw insomniacs nightmare not to long ago for the first time and i have to say i really found it to be quite good if you are a fan of dominic monaghan you will love it the hole movie takes place inside his mind or does it the acting from everyone else is a little rushed and shaky and some of the scenes could be cut down but it works out in the end the extras on the dvd are just as great as the film if not greater for those dom fans it has tons of candid moments from the set outtakes and a great interview with the director anyone who has gone through making an independent film will love to watch tess the director dom and everyone else on the very small close personal set try to bang out this little trippy creepy film it was pretty enjoyable and im glad to have it in my collection
167,well i have finally caught up with rock n roll high school almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979 latecomer that i am i will probably first see this summers new documentary patti smith dream of life sometime around 2040 and no the film doesnt feel dated one bit and yes it was worth the wait this is a very highenergy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments it tells the story of riff randell adorably played by pj soles and the battle that she and her fellow students at vince lombardi high wage against their new repressive principal miss togar danny peary in his book cult movies quite accurately describes mary woronovs performance as an evil eve arden a typical teens vs establishment story line is beefed up here with some absurdist humor those exploding mice that giant mouse the hansel and gretel hall monitors and some truly rousing tunes riff is of course the 1 fan of that original punk band the ramones and that band dishes out a bakers dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film including five at a concert that is a total blast indeed the sight of riff furiously dancing to teenage lobotomy at this blowout may be the pictures funniest moment and the initial appearance of joey johnny dee dee and marky in their ramonesmobile and later slinking down a street singing i just wanna have something to do is quite exhilarating the film ends with an explosive confrontation that is i would imagine every high school kids wet dream fun stuff indeed on a side note the ramones were one of the loudest bands that i have ever seen in concert so i was very amused to note that the dvd for this film comes with optional english subtitles for the hearing impaired how many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary i wonder
168,i saw this film at the chicago reeling film festival to pick up on the previous reviewers remarks the claustrophobic feel and off colors of the film is i sense quite intentional and conveys the sense of limited space drab architecture overall drabness that constitutes the urban environment of most people in eastern and central europe a bit shabby housing project style is how id describe it and this is how many people live on the outskirts of larger cities i cant say that im familiar with bucharest romania where the action unfolded but i have visited and lived in eastern europe for six months when i visited russia as a student for a semester my entire group had to drag their luggage seven stories up the staircase of a shabby student dorm building just as the heroine does when moving in with a woman because the elevators werent working but i do concur with the reviewer that the claustrophobia and muted colors its overdone for there are to be sure beautiful historic buildings parks squares you can find in bucharest or in any historic city center of eastern europe and bucharests didnt get much of any footage in this film for me watching this film conveys well the claustrophobia that i would feel during my halfyear stay there feeling trapped and limited it makes you see why someone would want to immigrate and find a better life just as people if hope to escape from a united states urban ghetto also given the climate of homophobia say circa us in the 1980s the two young women who fall in love with one another are forced to keep their love a very private matter hence the focus on their interaction in the apartmentits remarkable and commendable in my view that this queer themed film was even made in romania and i find the complaint of the previous reviewer about the poor film quality quite uninformed and patronizing its unlikely that the director and producer drummed up much government support and funding for their film and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources the actors were fairly good and believable the dialog was overall well done and i could identity with these womenthe film offers an added twist to that of forbidden love between two young women kiki an energetic funloving free spirit with a dark troubling secret her admiration and love for an abusive incestuous brother sandu falls in love with alexandra a bright bookish idealistic young woman who moves to bucharest to begin her college studies opposites attract and their personalities seem to complement one another though there is some tension between the ambitious studious intellectual alexandra and kiki who seems to be attending college to please her parents keeping their love hidden from their parents seems manageable though we dont get any sense of the tension it requires nor do we ever see or meet any other studentshard to believeand the tension keeping their love secret would have entailed the chief threat to their love is kikis brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him but kikis love for alexandra seems to give her the strength she needs to finally severe this bond or does it thats what the suspense of the film focuses on as the narrative develops and i wont say how it concludesironically kikis love sickness isnt love for another woman but her illicit incestuous love for her brother thus loving a woman offers the potential cure to the sickness of loving a sibling though this feel of this film is stifling and claustrophobic overly confined to interactions between kiki and alexandra it was still engaging and moving to watch so ill give it a 7
169,what an awesome movie it was very scary great acting wellwritten nice plot twists interesting characters very good direction and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on your face this is one popcorn horror flick that may not be appealing to nonhorror fans but is still nonetheless one of the best thrillers out there today i highly recommend it to only fans of1 the horror genreor2 an actor or actress featured in it out of  starsps i am sick and tired of people comparing this and other modern horror movies with scream ya know what they didnt want to be like scream everyones like oh they copied scream well if i am not mistaking scream also copied other movies too in fact just about every horror movie copied an earlier one scream however was a good film but still stop comparing and enjoy it for what it isgo and rent this one
170,pressburger and powells greatest movie david niven plays the raf bomber pilot who misses his own death but is granted a second chance at life when heaven notices that he is awol and dispatches an angel to investigate the scene when the young soldiers men and women black and white all killed in action arrive in heaven to be processed for eternal life is unbearably poignant watch out too for roger livesey a deeply under appreciated actor and kim hunter as the love interest later of course zira in planet of the apes incidentally steven spielberg cast the actress who played the chief angel kathleen byron as the elderly wife of the eponymous private in saving private ryan half a century later an act that speaks volumes for his cinematic literacy
171,a brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there on itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story so there is more there is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the playerthis film steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite nicely its easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film the added effect of the tournament is very good too and creates a nice tension settingi have no idea of the strength of the chess players as i dont play the game myself but it looks nice and believable all in all most of the film goes down very easily it is also forgotten again very easily though so its nice to watch but nothing more than that7 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place
172,this movie surprised me some things were clicheish and some technological elements reminded me of the movie enemy of the state starring will smith but for the most part very entertaining good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo providing some comic relief this is a movie you can watch over againsay some wednesday night when nothing else is on i gave it a 9 for entertainment value
173,the luzhin defence is a good film with fine central performances but too much of the novel and not enough of the filmmakers craft shines through it felt through most of the film that the characters just helped to push the narrative along marlene gorris could perhaps have examined the psyche of luzhin rather than depicting him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of othersadapting literature for the screen is clearly a difficult task especially a novel written in the early 20th century this film does not go deeply enough into the relationship between luzhin and natalia natalias rift with her mother comes across a churlish disagreement by the mother rather than a dramatic flashpoint in the film i felt that i was put through luzhins torment and eventual tragic end without being given the pleasure of having his unusual and complex personality unravelled however this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not a great one
174,the simple hand camera both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film and also relates to the dogma filmsdid you ever get bored of those hollywoodstyle cop flicks with brawny guys who get assignments james bond would be envious of fed up with the marriedlivingsingle cop the divorcedbutfamilyman the personified doughnut and the tough hunter ever wondered how the real police work is likewell for germany this film shows you set in the north between west germany and east germany former ddr an laid off post office clerk starts her job fresh from policeschool she quickly finds her way around the usual customers and becomes accustomed to life as a policewoman but this is not much funother german crime films like derrick der alte et cetera have dignified officers talking calmly with suspects these cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder good dialogue and realism makes this an interesting view even more if you know that part of germany a bit
175,growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the 20s and 30s i grew up very close to most of the italian families living there this move brought back so many pleasant memories this is a movie most people would like who enjoy seeing more true to life movies
176,what can you say when you see a good french movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters the major point is we believe in those characters and once theyve met each other we want them to stay together its simple and really efficient the background story is less important why does the screenplay go on the side of a halfdeveloped thriller it helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most french filmjerkers like to make not too much ambition right sur mes lèvres is only an entertaining french film with good characterizationfor all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy it goes quite as easy as in rear window an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film but with a less compelling context where i am amazed its to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased he brings very little to the story when he appears alone we wonder if weve not missed a part before jacques audiard is not a newcomer yet strange and weird
177,ive been a fan of xu ke hark tsui for many year since school this film is the best fantasy movie in years i dont think action is the right genre though therere lot of action and kongfu scenese wait did i mentioned this is an oriental fantasy moive please keep in mind that do not use hollywood formula to rate this film and for the guy who poo around i dont blame you cause you still young and need to know more about culture
178,there is not much more i can say about this movie than all of the commentaries on page one except  as jesse says  its the berries all of page ones commentators wrote eloquently  as almost so as the dialog is in this movie this just may be one of those illusive things we hear so much about but usually are made so by the actors who deliver the lines a beautiful script maybe robert redford did hold strict sway onto the actorsactresses during the filming of this movie so that the beauty of the story would not get losti too attended church when i was very young and into my late teens the churchs pastor spoke very eloquently and quietly as the rev maclean did in his church that in itself is a totally different picture that is portrayed of southern baptist churches  no holyrollering in my church it was a big church with many different programs to keep its congregation busy  the most inspiring perhaps was the musicdepartment with its huge choir and almost classical anthems too the sunday eveningcongregation was almost entirely younger people are you even aware it was once safe to go to church on sunday night how i wish it still was  watching a river runs through it is very much like going to hear a beautiful sermon in a church whose members are fully involved in life as has already been so beautifully written the sermon for this movie is the openspace beauties of montana  yet arent there also missilesilos there too flyfishing or any other activity which draws familymembers closer together for a happy life  and deep understanding of one another  becomes a blessing although you see some of the shadier aspects of life then too the simplicity of the story paints a lasting impression on your heart if you let it speakeasies and prostitutes are counterbalanced by the simple gatherings of oldfashioned community picnics as this movie contains  in heavy contrasts to modern families taking their kids to disney land for screeching joyrides and calling it a day together there is noting wrong with that but as river demonstrates some of its taciturn beauty could do nothing but make life richer this is the third film ive seen in which tom skeritt  plays a father all different styles and brilliantly actedbrad pitt mostly an undiscovered talent except for thelma and louise and meet joe black and all of the castmembers deserved many awards little stories superbly told will get 10of10 from me over any movie with violence foul language ugliness and action i am thinking particularly of crash and most of arnolds movies what a savior for peace this movie is
179,in todays world of digital fabrication there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer alas this type of character driven film is far too rare these days duvalls performance as well as james earl jones are faithful to their audiences high expectations i wonder if this movie was made for tv it has a closeup personal quality to the narrative it is an understatement to say that the performances are all outstanding the only thing that keeps it from being a cinema masterpiece is the lack of a great cinematographer but pretty pictures are not everything how can talent the likes of jones and duvall continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the digitizing
180,of all the versions of the odyssey or of any greek mythological story for that matter this in my opinion is the best of them all almost true to the original storyline  with some minor deviations and omissions eg the absence of scylla  charybdis and the fact that eumaeus the swineherd recognizes odysseus in disguise in his hut  realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiecenot some hollywoodish swordandsandal bflick notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in italian if one is familiar with the storyline he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying provided you have a good handy text of the odyssey at hand at least i did and so much so that it has inspired me to study the italian language to better appreciate the movie even more
181,sterling and younger brother try to survive on land being squeezed by big cattlemen when rogue brother preston arrives a moral dilemma ensues john drew barrymore steals the show as the younger impressionable brotherbarrymore shows signs here that he could have been an acting powerhouse moves at a nice pace to an exciting climax
182,yeah the poster is quite a horrible piece of worki thought the movie was oknothing really outstandingi just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his lifeahh but that cant happen to rich kids now can it not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansionnothe kid is too good to have his life totally trashed after all who will drive the brand new suv and who will go to law school ah the poor little rich kidsin their quaint pretty house with their ivy league schools ultra clean homes and socialite partieswhat will the world do without them i hope they all get addicted to drugs passaway their life and end up in jailso maybe we can see movies that dont all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world
183,all the worlds a stage and its people actors in itor something like that who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pitor even at the theatre door why is not the audience participants in the theatrical experience including the story itselfthis film was a grand experiment that said hey the story is you and it needs more than your attention it needs your active participation sometimes we bring the story to you sometimes you have to go to the storyalas no one listened but that does not mean it should not have been said
184,before i watched this tv movie i did not know much about one of my favorite actresses after watching it i realized how sad lucille balls life really was it had its great moments too but i didnt realize how sad it was this movie was very good and told the story of the beloved lucille ball very well i highly reccommend it
185,i saw el mar yesterday and thought it to be a great movie it starts with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters ramallo manuel tur and francisca after that we jump about 10 years to an hospital where the 3 friends meet againreligion sickness love violence and sexuality rage throughout the movie creating and intense and tensionfilled moviei see people complaining about the film being too gory and i think they missed the point of the story its a violent intense and sad story people are expected to suffer to cry to get hurt to bleed and i think that what the film shows isnt done for pure shockvalue or presented in a distasteful way i know that some people like their films clean even those with violence in it but sometimes a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work this is one of those movies and a great movie it isthe only fault i found was that there were 3 or 4 moments were some plot details werent 100 clear and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie it all made sense but it wasnt anything of much importance to the overall story so i still give this movie a 9
186,rock n roll high school was one of the best movies ever made i think the only reason it was so awesome was because of the ramones you couldnt have made the same movie and put something like the sex pistols or the clash in place of the ramones it just wouldnt have been the same dey young clint howard vincent van patten mary woronov paul bartel and the hall monters just added to the movie the whole entire movie is about the ramonesespecially joey so everybody showed see rock n roll high school if your a huge fan of real punk not the sissy new crapbut the loud and fast kind the kind only the ramones could do rip rest in peace joey ramone 19512001 dee dee ramone 19522002
187,this movie is wonderfuli was enchanted i should say and surprised because of how uniquely it was done the cast the sequencing the effectseverything magnificent i mean it was a love story yes but what made it outstanding from the rest was that it was told in an entertaining wholesome mannerfor me it is the representation of modern fairy tale its like the modern peter pansimply amazingi surely would buy a copy of this the moment it hit the marketthis movie is really a double must see one 10 stars for that
188,if you want to learn something about the spanish civil war and about all the political details and intrigues let me tell you youve chosen the wrong filmthis is a vision of the war as it happened in majorca a small island off the coast of spain when a war like this happens in a small island that takes position for the traitor almost at once there is no war in the open the soldiers are sent to the front to fight in the mainland while another kind of war happens at home on the small island there neighbours tell on other neighbours sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime but many people are told on because of old family fights or maybe the silent introvert who has no friends is told on by someone who wants to earn some points and these things dont happen in the open there were some trials true but many other times people would just be woken up in the middle of the night taken out of their homes to the closest cemetery where they would be killed and the next morning the bodies would be found and people would have an idea of what had happened but nobody would dare to speak or to do anything were not talking about soldiers killing someone they had never seen in their life were talking about people killing their neighbours and probably saying hello to their widow the next day and even attending the funeral for the guy they had killed were talking about villages with one or two thousand inhabitants where everybody knew everybodyi am from that small island and ive heard the stories my grandparents told me and i must say that this film upset me oh yes it did but i also found it remarkably beautiful and moving the initial violence is not something the director or the writer made up thats how things happened during that war a kid knowing that his mates dad is in the fascist squad that killed his dad completely possible all that happened later on possible too tb was real too at that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become people were poor illiterate and worked in small farms after the war there were times of hardshipso you wont find a war story in this film or at least not the kind of war story you expect there are no battlefields no soldiers no political intrigues this is the meanest kind of war which happens when the space is limited just check the size of the island when neighbours fight with their neighbours when members of the same family fight each other and they live in a place where everybody knows everybody youll find a story about the damage that this particular kind of war can cause to people and the story of how they survive that damage or maybe they donti must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors who managed to sound really majorcan that was remarkable
189,someone release this movie on dvd so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the socalled films of the 1990s and see how vapid they were for the most part and how lars von trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece as it stands zentropa or europa as it is referred to outside the us is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the bleakness and almost psychotic uncertainty that oozed out of post wwii europe namely the decimated german landscape whose physical horrors were matched only by the damage to the psyche of its people von trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen you will feel like you are watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late 1940s with the perfectly lighted black and white scenes while at the same time feel you are on the brink of something beyond the cutting edge especially in scenes like the assassination aboard the train literally when you see this movie you are witnessing the evolution of an art form for some reason von trier got caught up in his own dogma movement shortly after this and while his breaking the waves and dancer in the dark are classics in their own right it is with zentropa that he truly lifted the art of film making to new and exciting heights 1010 ages like a fine wine and begs for a dvd release
190,this film captured my heart from the very beginning when hearing quincy jones first notes or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flowers in the meadows this is truly a film to cry and die for the whole cast gives the best performance in a film ive seen in years and spielberg has really outdone himself whoppi goldberg margaret avery oprah winfreyoh lord danny glover and the others all give us their best and you can feel it  almost touch it goldberg is celie she gives her that insecurity and feeling of inferiority that is needed for the character and we grow with her we grow strong together with her throughout the movie and we triumph with her margaret avery is wonderful as shug avery even when shes at her most arrogant and shows us that sinners indeed have souls too the always sympathetic charming danny glover makes a marvellous job at making people hate him and the magnificent music ofid say sirquincy jones adds even more beauty to this splendid film the photography the music the director and the music makes this beautiful soulful movie into an experience of life you dont want to miss it sistaremember my name
191,now i have seen a lot of movies in my day but out of every single one there have been a very select few that have been really good to me and im a 19 year old man which is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience this is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies almost all the acting is believable the graphics are decent for which you wont even be caring about as you watch the movie trust me bitching about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do the story is well written and its a movie that everyone can enjoy not just the kidsheres basically what this movie made me to it one made me laugha lot two made me feel for the characters like youre suppose to and three its a very uplifting story by the end of this movie you will feel good sure what anime out there hasnt featured some young kid turning into a great warrior and whatever to defeat some great evil its a formula that is used a lot but in this case it is forgivable because even though they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics youd see 5 years ago the appearance of it is not to be judged its very touching the ending is original and it keeps you into the movie like it is suppose to if you however try comparing this to other movies like the neverending story or whatever it will diverse your opinion watch it as it is and you will enjoy itit has been a good long while since ive been impressed like this the only other movie where i have gotten this feeling is when i saw tmnt way back when it came out there is something about this movie i felt about tmnt that really made me love it so dont overanalyze or take this movie too seriously just enjoy it
192,read my lips sur mes lèvres which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its french title is a nifty twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slopethe two leads are magnetic emmanuelle devos who ive never seen before despite her lengthy resume in french movies and an even more disheveled than usual vincent cassel who has brought a sexy andor threatening look and voice to some us moviesthe first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and hes the neophyte the second half is on his turf as an excon and her wrenching adaptation to that milieuwriterdirector jacques audiard very cleverly uses the womans isolating hearing disability as an entrée for us into her perceptions turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does so its even more annoying than usual when audience members talk using visuals as sensory reactors as wellnone of the characters act as anticipated she is not like that pliable victim from in the company of men not in individual interactions not in scenes and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line well until the last shot but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment as we move from a hectic modern office to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stakeouts there is a side story thats thematically redundant and unnecessary but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breathsthis is one of my favorites of the year originally written 7282002
193,this is one of the best movies to come from bollywood in years certainly the best this year until now indian to the core the panoramic visuals the heartpleasing dialogs and the melodious and soft music make the movie an exceptional one the apt depiction of indianvalues and culture makes the viewer search for hisher roots in them and invigorates the mind and spirit with a sense of pride and a new lease on lifethis movie is for viewers who enjoy a call to their imagination and philosophical senses if you like watching movies to get all your nerves excited through onscreen action sex or terror then this movie is not for you because you will find that the movie is not full of 90 degrees twists in it it is as simple a story for a movie as it can get but thats exactly where the art of the movie lies one gets a real life experience and the best thing is this experience is one full of values and hope it is about the positive side of life about the sweet things that god has showered on humans as against the regressive movies that insist on showing dons terrorists and underworlds this is not about things and people that have gone bad it is about the goodness that still persists and that keeps the world running of course every genre of movies is respectable but it takes a lot of courage and talent to come up with a movie that swims against the current and tries to open the eyes of the public to the hidden realities and truths having said that heres more the movie is the journey of a couple from their engagement to their arranged marriage  yes thats right it is an arranged marriage and the couple come to know each other only through their parents and learn to love each other the 6 month gap between engagement and marriage is a long time not full of enticing happenings but one that nurtures the growing love and devotion of the couple to each other they learn together the importance of their relationship and of this invaluable period of their lives and work to strengthen the bonds of marriage but have these been strengthened enough their relationship will face the test of not only time but also fortune will they pass this test that is what vivah is about

195,i must say that i had wanted to see this film for a long time and i was not disappointed the acting of dominic monaghan is simply fantastic as a part insomniac myself i can relate with how the story develops i have never experienced anything of the sort but some awake moments overlap the sleeping and it can be scary it was a great film worth every penny i hope that one day i can work with tess myself it would be an honor and beyond i can recommend it for everybody maybe not small children as they may get scared but if you are an insomniac like me youll understand the world the mysteries and the fear youll love it f
196,although this was obviously a lowbudget production the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing one of walkens few musical roles to date he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well  watch for the cartwheel also starring jason connery a great childrens story and very likable characters
197,contains slight spoilersits interesting how anthony mann uses james stewart here stewart is of course remembered by many as george bailey from frank capras its a wonderful life so its easy to find parallels between the two films in its a wonderful life bailey gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never been born in the far country stewarts jeff webster by not getting involved to help anyone else except himself gets to see essentially the same thing a world in which he for all practical matters doesnt existby not getting involved and by attempting not to care about anyone webster is forced to see those for whom he cant help but care get hurt pushed around and even killed while he stands by and does nothing this reminds the viewer of george bailey watching a world that has turned upsidedown because he has also decided not to get involved by not ever having been born both movies end with the same image  a closeup of a ringing bell stewart by turning around his philosophy of noninvolvement has it would seem earned his wings
198,i think this film has much to recommend it particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr foxx although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very very hard to follow in some cases all in all it makes for a nice time in front of the tube
199,i have seen a lot of saura films and always found amazing the way he assembles music dance drama and great cinema in his movies ibéria shows an even better saura dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music another thing that called my attention is the fact that in this movie dancers and musicians dance and music are equally important the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation examining not only technical issues but also the emotional experience of playing the interest of saura on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other works thats why i recommend it strongly to those who love good cinema good music good dance great art
200,protocol is a hitandmiss picture starring goldie hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting arab from an assassination attempt the woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job working for the us government will the corridors of power in our nations capital ever be the same hawn is excellent as usual even though protocol isnt as funny as her best film private benjamin but its still a good movie and i did laugh alot out of four
201,not being a fan of first person shooters i was very hesitant to play this game after having played the demo however i was sold undying really manages to pull you in the game and be part of the universe that your character is in you have this green amuletcalled the gelziabar stone that has special powers and warns you of particular events or things to look at with a special spell the scrye you can see certain things that otherwise would be invisible to you walking in a hallway you suddenly hear the magical stone whisper lookwith the stone glowing at for example a painting and then using the scrye spell you can see some weird and creepy stuff on the painting let me tell you to witness something like that is scary as hell people who expect to finish this game in a few hours can forget about that even with the use of cheats this game relies on the character using wits and walking carefully around because like in any horror movie your surroundings are usually pretty dark and ghosts and monster appear at random when you dont expect them and can kill you very quickly there is this one scene where you want to enter a room where you are pushed back with such great force that it takes moments for you to realize what happened this was a scene that could have come straight out of the horror classic evil dead to experience something like this is a real accomplishment there are a lot of elements that take undying to the level of the best classic horror movies ever produced but sadly i have to report that there are some flaws for one thing the universe you are playing in is huge you start out in a big mansion with all sorts of hiddensecret rooms and even a hidden hell dimension called oneiros that is all fine in the beginning but with all the loading times and some difficult enemies in between that can become frustrating and there is no map the game demands you memorize your surroundings so patience is required also there are some jumping puzzles that you have to do otherwise you cant progress i dont mind jumping on platforms in third person adventures but in first person mode that can be an annoying task luckily you can save at anytime and anyplace and trust me you will need it overall undying is an extraordinary first person shooter that deserves to be played by any horror or game fan
202,one of the best if not the best rocknroll movies ever and its not just mindless fun there really were a lot of clever jokes in it of course i love the ramones but with all the anarchy and the i hate high school themes the film doesnt at all take itself too seriouslywhich is whats great about iti first saw the movie in the spring of 1980 and i saw it again recently since i went to high school in the late 1970s it made me kind of nostalgic like i said this film doesnt take itself that seriously and isnt pretentious like so much other teen fare of the seventies eighties and nineties and to speak of its not really dirty or disgusting either only pg rated thats rare for a movie in this category a great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule
203,i enjoy watching people doing breakdance especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called roxy especially at christmas time because there also appears a mc santa clauseven if this is an old film and even if i have videotaped it from tv when the state movie archive of finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen i went there to check it out its much more enjoyable on big screen than on tveven if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost i disagree with this and i think that when i paid my ticket i got the moneys worth by seeing this as it is on big screen especially seated on front row of the cinema an unforgettable experience and much better than just on video
204,scott bartletts offon is nine minutes of pure craziness it is a fullfrontal assault of psychedelic pulsating epilepsyinducing flashing lights and colours and the first true merging of film and video in avantegarde cinema theres no story to speak of but bartlett uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highlyindustrial form of modern technology in a sense the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools his machinery his technology this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal9000 in stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey 1968 and indeed bartletts opening sequence of images  flashing colours before a closeup human eye  recalls dave bowmans journey through the stargate the visuals are richlycoloured a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasinglygrainy video as though were sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact the end product was recorded from a tv monitorthere appears to be some confusion about the films release date imdb lists the film as a 1972 release but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the films completion and its first public screening either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video and some brisk techno music wouldnt have gone amiss either offon captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information i had a thought  and please dont laugh at this freethinking interpretation  that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earths television signals might very well receive such a disjointed alien documentation of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguelyfamiliar imagery that couldnt possibly make any coherent sense perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality
205,this movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters i popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover let alone reviews and was intrigued for two solid hours two lost ships from two different worlds collide the sexual tension that brews between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly any physical contact toward the end i couldnt decide which i wanted more our hero and heroine to pull off their caper or simply consummate their passion rml couldve done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been plenty im nitpicking though after a series of netflix blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making
206,i saw this movie while it was under limited release mainly for the novelty of seeing pierce brosnan with a moustache but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies i have seen all year it starts out almost as a thriller but steadily progresses into a hilarious piece of work full of oneliners and great comedic energy between pierce brosnan and greg kinnear also while i say this movie is a comedy it doesnt forget it has a heart at times and can be very touching when it needs to be when i went into the theater i didnt know what to expect much more than a moustache but what i got was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time leaving the theater i felt very fulfilled from the film and plan to see it again in wide release i recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a wellwritten script and a big moustache
207,a wonderful film by powell and pressburger whose work i now want to explore more the film is about what we perceive as real and what is real and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another beautifully shot and acted although david niven doesnt seem to be 27 years old as his character claims to be fun to see a very young richard attenborough this film made me think while i was watching it and afterwards
208,i just watched the last wave in my schools fine arts library its intriguing like all peter weirs stuff but its not always as attentionholding as i would have liked i found myself fascinated by the ideas being thrown at me because they are very well handled by the films director weirbut at the same time i was not stimulated enough by them aka i got a little bored in spotsthe plot surrounds an aussie lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain dreams he has which link him to an aborigone group he is defendingit starts out with an intense weather sequence and has some very awesome mood effects throughout most notably the bizarre belching sound designand strong direction but it just didnt entertain me like weirs later films do i might just need to watch it again thoughgood film about obsession and mystery because in the end the mystery that exists between the whites and the aboriginies offers some very severe consequencesgod bless peter weir though for him alone this film is worth watching  very organic director like an aussie response malick id give it a 7 because its got enough great ideas to overcome its boring moments
209,zentropa is the most original movie ive seen in years if you like unique thrillers that are influenced by film noir then this is just the right cure for all of those hollywood summer blockbusters clogging the theaters these days von triers followups like breaking the waves have gotten more acclaim but this is really his best work it is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor its too bad he decided handheld cameras were the wave of the future its hard to say who talked him away from the style he exhibits here but its everyones loss that he went into his heavily theoretical dogma direction instead
210,zombie chronicles isnt something to shout about its obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining bmovie directed by brad sykes who directed camp blood which was another entertaining low budget flick the acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but thats what makes it more entertaining the zombie makeup is cool and effective especially with the budget the gore is also great and gross the film is sort of like a zombie version of tales from the crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale zombie chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you love low budget bmovies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out zombie chronicles
211,the industry dropped the ball on this the trailer does not do the movie justice and when this opened it was on a hand full of screens had people had an opportunity to see this work of mouth would have made it very successful the 2 lead actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you in to the story and especially the characters i checked this out based on the rave recommendation richard roeper or ebert and roeper in his book an example of a great film that never got fully released except on a few screens which gave it no chance to be seen some movies go to video quickly because they arent that good this is oscar worthy and its a tragedy on many levels that most will never even hear of it maybe via word of mouth it will gain a following on dvd or cable if you havent see this movie you should great performances of the 2 lead actresses make this movie it could have just been another formulaic teen movie after school special but instead it stands up well to other note worthy films girl interrupted comes to mind if you like that you will like this both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without coming off as melodramatic even though alicia is angry and deanna is crying through most of the movie it is done is such a real way that they do not come off as stereotypical characters or as melodramatic the movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor use these real performances as your school erica is even better in this than in traffic i hope both of these actors get more roles that utilize their talents as well and let them shine see this movie and if you like recommend to friends so it doesnt get lost among all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year this movie was buried while spiderman 2 tops records what kind of word are we living in aghhh so to make the world right again see this and recommend it
212,i cant believe currently this movie is rated a 69 anyway this movie was probably one of the most touching real indian movies i have ever seen it was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema as for the story i thought it was great it was about shahid kapur being set up on an arranged marriage with amrita rao he is kind of a happy go lucky kind of guy while amrita rao is a traditional indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle but the only problem is her cousin doesnt seem to get as much attention as she does so her aunt dislikes amrita with a passion this upsets amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her it was also very touching to see that although amritas family wasnt that rich maybe just middle class to lower class while shahids family was quite upper class they still treated their family with respect and didnt even ask put them down which really struck a nerve with me this is because ive actually seen people being very rude to people who are not as well of thinking their below their standards which i feel is very shallow this movie showed that shahids family was willing to look at the great values that amrita had been brought up with and turned a blind eye to the fact she wasnt a rich business tycoons daughter or anything all in all this movie deserved an 810 i wish more and more of these kind of movies were made
213,workingclass romantic drama from director martin ritt is as unbelievable as they come yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars jane fonda and robert de niro both terrific shes a widow who cant move on hes illiterate and a closetinventoryou can probably guess the rest adaptation of pat barkers novel union street a better title is so laidback it verges on bland and the films editing is a mess but its still pleasant a rosyhued bluecollar fantasy there are no overtures to serious issues even the illiteracy angle is just a plottool for the ensuing love story and no real fireworks though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree the finale is pure fluffand cynics will find it difficult to swallowthough these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldnt really be satisfying any other way  from 
214,the matador 2005  _ pierce brosnan greg kinnear hope davis philip baker hall dylan baker brosnan gives one of his best nonbondian roles as a middleaged assassin facing a midlife crisis while on assignment in mexico where he befriends a square yet likable american businessman kinnear at his most affable and discovers there is more to life than death newbie filmmaker richard shepard makes a solid big screen debut with a pointedly wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breathoffreshair into the buddy comedy formula skewering what is anticipated of his leads and allowing brosnan to get his yayas out with devilish glee a sleeper gem indie hit
215,a movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story the luzhin defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty depth and character	it gives john turturro what is probably his finest role to date thank goodness they didnt give it to ralph fiennes who would have murdered it similarly emily watson shows the wealth of her experience from her outstanding background on the stage to reach the tortured chess master turturro her character has to display intelligence as well as a womans love watson does not portray beautypageant sexuality but she brings to her parts a selfawareness that is alluring	in a chance meeting between natalia watson and luzhin she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing  a specially crafted piece that we realize later in the film has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations later as their love affair develops she subtly likens dancing to chess luzhin has learnt to dance but never with a partner she encourages him to lead her with bold brilliant moves and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best and also realize himself as her lover	this is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment emotionally and intellectually or so we are led to believe  certainly within the time frame natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother	the italian sets are stunning the complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent moviegoer yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit and most deservedly so chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for developing an emotional and emotive movie although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chessplayer that the characters existed although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting
216,sequel to the kingdom is bloodier and even more twisted i only saw half i was exhausted and couldnt sit through all 5 12 hours but i loved what i saw ghosts blood murder poisoning mutated babies voodoothis has it all if you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for youalso you dont have to see part 1 to understand thisyoull figure it outdoes anyone know if kingdom 1 and 2 are available on dvd sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is tiring sadly there probably wont be a kingdom 3ernsthugo jaregard sig died a year after this was filmed but you never know
217,what a wonderful fanciful movie stardust isi could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see itat a time when hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats stardust makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place  to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives other times or other planets ironically stardust takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike glee we all long forstardust is full of all the characters we remember as children princes witches pirates ghosts and scoundrels it has the damsel in distress the hero the rogues the obstacles spells antidotes charms and even a touch of lightspeed to make it quasi modernstardust is about a man from the town of wall which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom the only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger played wonderfully by david kelly one day a young man from wall named ben barnes out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech he happens upon an enchanted kingdom called stormhold where he meets a chained and very sexy young lady named una she is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain while the witch is away una seduces ben and sends him on his way ben returns to wall without incident and continues his life but nine months later he is summoned to the wall breech where the old guard hands him what you might expect  a baby boythe boy named tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man charlie cox who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also betrothed to another nevertheless the young lady named victoria and played sienna miller goes out once with tristain and he confesses his love to her after they espy a falling star she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her he agrees and sets out on his quest which will take him to the other side of the wallmeanwhile in the kingdom of stormhold the old king perfectly played by peter otoole is dying he calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne his sons names are primus secondus sextmus and septimus the other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throneanyway he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and voila that what brings the star to earththe star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named yvaine clare danes and she of course is wearing the charm but little does she know she is now being persuaded by tristain the princes and also an aging witch named lamia michelle pfeiffer who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youthcomplicated yes but it all comes together as the adventure unfoldstristain is the first to find yvaine but is so blinded by his devotion to victoria he doesnt recognize the growing bond between he and yvaine his initial interest lie only in returning yvaine to victoria as proof of his love but he must get past the princes and lamia first the princes arent that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other  and just as in pirates of the caribbean  never has death been so funny but tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother though he doesnt know its his mother and a band of flying pirates led by robert denirohis is the most important character in the movie and deniro plays it to a tee he steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter though his role is small in length deniro is extraordinarymichelle pfeiffer is wonderful as lamia  a sexy evil witch claire danes is most appropriate as the confused and distressed yvaine she makes a perfect damsel jason flemyng adam buston rupert everett and mark strong add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting princes whom as they die return as ghosts ala blithe spirit and high spiritsmoreover director matthew vaughn whose only other directing experience was layer cake weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoystardust may be too complex for young children but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie multiple times its that good stardust is what movies are supposed to be perfectly written perfectly cast perfectly directed and perfectly acted in other wordsperfect
218,not having read nabokov and knowing nothing about chess i could only view the luzhin defence as a movie it works really well as one of my favorite genres sports romances the chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in say searching for bobby fischer in showing just how much hard mental work the game can be requiring thought preparation stamina and planning i particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipatedthrough the feminist director maureen gorris of antonia emily watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens via her transformative relationship with john turturros fairly onenote absentminded intense chess geniusthe settings in italy and hungary are beautifuloriginally written 5272001
219,even if youre not a big ramones fan rock n roll high school is still the greatest rock n roll movie ever made why because under all the campiness it treats with respect the contempt and loathing teens often feel and justifiably so for the boring stupid fascist establishment world of adults that final scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting final scenes to a movie i have ever seen mine eyes have seen the glory of the rock n roll
220,prior to seeing show people my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick and slapstick only i could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken word or numerous pratfalls but this masterful film proved me wrong davies in my view was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to lucille ball i mention lucy primarily because davies mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point that i wonder if davies wasnt one of balls primary influences this is coming from a 21 year old who had never before seen silent comedy and i must say that no matter how much of the periodspecific references you actually get i didnt apparently you will not be bored by this movie you will probably even laugh more than you would at most talkie comedies this is not only my favorite silent comedy but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time
221,walking home after the film i was humming the familiar waltz music that natalia and alexandre were dancing to ive heard that before  where ah from kubricks eyes wide shut track 2 got it just as i arrived at the door its waltz no 2 from jazz suite no 2 composed by dimitri shostakovich performed here by the city of prague philharmonic orchestra yes i went and picked up the soundtrack from towers what a treat the film score by alexandre desplat was fulfilling  there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz its not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score reminds me of favorite scores by maurice jarre ennio morricone beginning notes of track 6 have traces of nuovo cinema paradiso georges delerue and john barry there are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings celeste piano and harp emily watson and john turturro delivered a credibly consuming paired performance the love story their intimate connection is very much between alexandre and natalia  his childlike yet tormenting inner world and her generous and bold understanding of him  a relationship alone to them both director marleen gorris of antonias line 1996 academy awards best foreign language film from the netherlands gave us a quietly sensitive film  not without its unsettling human conflicts intrigues obsessions family strives lovingness and respect the frontend subject is the mindgame and mathematical logic of chess beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920s cinematography captures the serene beauty of lake como in northern italy near the swiss borderi highly recommend the soundtrack if you dont feel like going to the movies alexandre desplats lyrical film score of the luzhin defence is complete
222,i liked this movie i remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where riff randell played by pj soles is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to visualize that the ramones are in the room with her sing the song i want you around very very cool stuffit was fun energetic quirky and cool yes ill admit that the ending is wayway over the top and far fetched but it doesnt matter because it is fun this is a very fun movie its sex pot and rock n rocll foreveri read that cheap trick was the band who was originally to star in this but i do not know if this is true or not
223,its a strange yet somehow impressive story about love personnaly i never run over such a twistoff story in real life but i can image there isits a story that promises to be sick from the title but after i watch it i didnt get this feeling of sickness which i would surely have regarding society rules its something beautiful in this movie something impressivewhich i cannot contradict using any moral or society rulesthe movie focuses mostly on relation between kiki and alex you can see how this relation starts evolves and finally ends you feel the moment when this love blossoms the first whispers touchings you feel the connection and no moment i though this is immoral you even hope it will not break in the endit cannot breakits not right you feel the pain of being hart broken in the endbuti need also to add a negative spin to this commenti dont know if the story is not somehow showed to give the feeling that these relations are sick only in form but not in content you dont have the total story but only fragments when movie has started the relation between kiki and sandu was already in place so no clue about the nature of the relation you feel only a tension between thema fight between the need for love and desire to break this relation i think this line of kiki to sandu says all i want to stopand if you love me you will do as i ask youthis movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moraland wheres the limit between them i dont know if the idea of this movie is love conquers alleven social and moral standards or love is beautifulno matter how or where but in my opinion this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think
224,i loved the real mc coys 19571963 it is too bad that lydia reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear she was excellent in the show of course walter brennan was great as well as tony martínez i loved it when he called amos señor grampai have purchased season i on dvd and i cannot wait to buy seasons 26if only there would be more shows on television like this one everything would be better this show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared god bless all the departed members of the cast and pleasellydia reed make yourself known again to the public you are loved and respected the real mc coys will live forever
225,father of the pride was the best new show to hit television since family guy it was yet another masterpiece from the talented people at dreamworks animation like the simpsons the show centers around a nuclear family of white lions in this case it also contains many memorable supporting characters including roger the surly orangutan vincent the italianamerican flamingo the eccentric white tigers blake and victoria the faux patriotic snout brothers and chutney the elephant the other stars of the show are the sigfreid and roy they are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose manner making the most mundane activities entertaining the combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialog and controversial issues drugs prejudice etc is the source of the programs brilliancethe blame for this shows failure lies with nbc they opted to broadcast the episodes in no particular order perhaps being influenced by which guest stars they could promote rather than the more logical production order several times the show was preempted for an extra halfhour of such dreck as the biggest loser as if 60 minutes of that was not enough it is indeed an ill omen for the future of television as art if an original and daring show like this fails while fear factor and american idol dominateluckily the complete series was released on dvd and the show now has an opportunity to gain a larger following 1010
226,wow a danish movie with this kind of content i mean the actors the story the pictures the efx  everything was where it should be and a danish efx house producing those vfx  wow this is like the 2nd or 3rd time a danish fx has produces visual effects in that qualityspoiler ahead the twist with the ghostly children in the submarine was quite good but generally i did not feel the big chill which i would expect from a ghostmovie end of spoilerbut anyway this is a danish movie which i as a dane can be proud ofthe only bad about this is that it wasnt a danish director but a swedish
227,vincent prices followup to house of wax 1953 the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon similarly revolves around a bitter  albeit resourceful  showman though a remake the former shot in technicolor remains the superior effort that said apart from some resistible comic relief the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry it was another 3d showcase and occasional narrative shortcomings whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head this offers more than enough grand guignoltype thrills and overall camp value price hamming it up in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions impersonating missing star conjurers who had taken advantage of his genius to stand on its own two feet incidentally director brahms involvement here proves no mere coincidence  since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles both starring laird cregar he had previously helmed ie the lodger 1944 and hangover square 1945 the young leads are played by mary murphy as prices ingénue assistant and patrick oneal as her police detective boyfriend  curiously enough he would himself take the lead in a similar piece chamber of horrors 1966 which i have acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this one an interesting sideline here is the latters adoption of a novel detection technique fingerprinting which is crucial in bringing about prices downfall in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climaxthough the persistent snooping of his amateur crime novelist landlady has at least as much to do with it in the long run watching the star in a madetomeasure role the film emerges a good deal of fun  particularly at a compact 73 minutes
228,this 1984 version of the dickens classic a christmas carol directed by clive donner stars george c scott as ebenezer scrooge by this time around the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again and happily to say with this film donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it he tells the story with precision and an eye to detail and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative especially scott one could argue that the definitive portrayal of scrooge one of the best known characters in literary fiction ever was created by alastair sim in the 1951 film but i think with his performance here scott has now achieved that distinction there is such a purity and honesty in his scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once youve seen scott do it simply put he is scrooge and what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous it is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well to be able to make a character so real from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face and to make it all ring so true its a study in perfectionthe other members of the cast are splendid as well but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of scotts performance and they do frank finlay is the ghost of jacob marley a notable turn though not as memorable perhaps as the one by alec guinness as marley in the film scrooge angela pleasence is a welcome visage as the spirit of christmas past edward woodward grand and boisterous and altogether convincing as the spirit of christmas present and michael carter grim and menacing as the spirit of christmas yet to comedavid warner hits just the right mark with his bob cratchit bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by scotts scrooge and susannah york fares just as well as mrs cratchit the real gem to be found here though is the performance of young anthony walters as tiny tim its heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin and simply one of the best interpretations and the most real ever presented on filmthe excellent supporting cast includes roger rees fred holywell and also the narrator of the film caroline langrishe janet holywell lucy gutteridge belle michael gough mr poole and joanne whalley fan a flawless presentation this version of a christmas carol sets the standard against which all others must be gauged no matter how many versions you may have seen watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever and forever after whenever you think of scrooge the image your mind will conjure up will be that of george c scott a thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home i rate this one 1010
229,this interesting giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory waysdirected by emilio p miraglia who one year earlier also made the very interesting la notte che evelyn usci della tomba see also my comment on that one the film starts off a little slow but all in all no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequencesthis film is a germanitalian coproduction but it was released in germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title horror house at least the murder scenes which will satisfy every gorehound are fully intact and the viewer still gets the killers motive at the end but the italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for of coursea convincing giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings la dama rossa uccide sette volte is highly recommended to giallo fans and slightly superior to miraglias above mentioned other thriller
230,this is the definite lars von trier movie my favorite i rank it higher than breaking the waves or the latest dancer in the dark i simply love the beauty of the picturethe framing is so original acting is wonderful a must see
231,what a strangely wonderful if sometimes slight and bulky bigbudget fantasy this is takashi miike had already proved by the time he got to the great yokhai war that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crimeyakuza genre visitor q and andromedia showed this the former great the latter lesser but here miike in his first and only coscreen writing credit no less proves that he can deliver the goods on a postmodern soup of mythical fantasy conventions and with it boatload of cgi creatureeffects and makeup and an epic battle that is more like a festival than something out of lord of the rings the comparisons can be made far and wide to be sure and the most obvious to jump on would be miyazaki for the seemingly unique mixture of kidsasbigheroes powerhungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source machinery as the greatest evil and many bizarrely defined flamboyantly designed creatures or yokai of the title but there can also be comparisons made to star wars especially to the gungan battle in tpm and to the whole powerplay between good and evil with similar forces or to anime like samurai 7 or of course to hensons films and through all of these comparisons and even through the flaws or overreaching moments its miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters here ryunosuke kamiki plays tadashi the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world but will become the hero in a world going into darkness the darkness is from an evil sorcerer who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures the yokhai into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission to destroy and kill anything in their paths tadashi gets as pumped up to fight sato the sorcerer as the yokai once satos main minion and cohort agi kill bills chiaki kuriyama another great villainies steals tadashis little furry companion a sunekosuri soon things come to a head in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories but can only be contained up to a point by miike and his crew i would probably recommend the great yokai war for kids but in the forward note that its not some watered down fantasy in american circles this has creatures galore including a oneeyed umbrella stand and a walking talking wall not to mention a turtle a fire serpent and a woman who became cursed by sato so the variety is on high on that end and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects which grows to unfathomable heights when the festival hits with the yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope but theres also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark and sunekosuri becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at miikes disposal and not just because its cuteness squared where else to get an audience riled up than over a little furry ball of fury who ends up in a tragic battle with tadashi in robot form yet through all of this the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of miikes career is here as well which distinguishes it from its animated muppet and scifi counterparts theres the bizarre humor as usual including a song dedicated to akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes i loved for example the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller or the anxious turtleyokai the biggest danger with miikes access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry which he flirts with is overkill on this end hes got everything down im sure with storyboards and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions one of them is when all is said and done and tadashi and the other human character are in the middle of the tokyo rubble in an overhead shot but the cgi is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots and the interplay skirts on being too flamboyant and some visuals like the overlay of the yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map just seem weak and pat i almost wondered if miike might dip into bad spy kids territory quite franklybut this liability aside the great yokai war provides more than a share of excitement goofy thrills and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies it owes a lot to cinema as well as traditional japanese folklore but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats its not the filmmaker at his very best but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage its got a neat little message and lots of cool adventure 7510
232,busy is so amazing i just loved every word she has ever done freaks and geeks dawsons creek white chicks the smokers after the first time i saw home room i went and got it the next day i am a big fan of her and she has a lot of fans here in israel if someone hasnt saw is excellent movie than dont waist more time and go see it now i recommend to all of you to see all of her movies i saw busy in the late night show with conan and she was so beautiful and cute i just love her everybody who saw the movie in home room she looks very scary but in real life she is so beautiful you have to see all her half nude pictures for stuff magazine maxim she looks so good there danielle
233,while i dont consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies stardust intrigued me based on seeing michelle pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain especially since i was about to see her as the bossy velma von tussle in hairspray boy is she so convincingly evil here as a witch especially with her ageugly makeup in the beginning and end robert de niro is also great as the pirate captain whos forced to hide in the closet to protect his reputation just about all the actors like claire danes rupert everett ricky gervais peter otoole and many others do fine work here while danes and pfeiffer are classic beauties theres also stunning faces of sienna miller olivia grant as girl bernard and kate magowan especially when we first meet her newcomer charlie cox is fine as the lead tristan and he looked so much like his father dunstan as a young man that i thought that was him in early scenes with magowan actually ben barnes many comments have compared this to the princess bride and while i can see some resemblances the main difference was that with pb you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson stardust makes you believe for the most part that what youre seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout so on that note i highly recommended stardust
234,emilio miraglias first giallo feature the night evelyn came out of the grave was a great combination of giallo and gothic horror  and this second film is even better weve got more of the giallo side of the equation this time around although miraglia doesnt lose the gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around and as a result its the typical giallo labyrinth with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes this is a definite bonus for the film however as while it can get a little too confusing at times theres always enough to hold the audiences interest and miraglias storytelling has improved since his earlier movie the plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle the legend revolves around a woman called the red queen who legend has it returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people a few years later murders begin to occureven though he only made two giallos miraglia does have his own set of tributes its obvious that the colour red is important to him as it features heavily in both films and he appears to have something against women called evelyn he likes castles gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too  which is fine by me miraglia may be no argento when it comes to spilling blood but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film and here we have delights involving a volkswagen beetle and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite giallo death scenes the female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning barbara bouchet and marina malfatti heading up an eyepleasing cast of ladies that arent afraid to take their clothes off the score courtesy of bruno nicolai is catchy and even though it doesnt feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in the night evelyn came out of the grave it fits the film well the ending is something of a turnoff as although miraglia revs up the gothic atmosphere it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious but even so this is a delightfully entertaining giallo and one that i highly recommend to fans of the genre
235,when this initially aired in 1984 my wife and i taped it on our very first vhs recorder i still have that aging tape which i try to watch annually it was the year my first child was born and seeing a christmas carol in this incarnation brings back fond memories of happy times  many hours of which were spent with this film playing in the background i finally broke down this year and ordered a dvd which prompted me to take a moment to write this brief reaction to the movie charles dickens story is captured in outstanding fashion here george c scott is absolutely amazing and totally believable as scrooge the supporting cast is equally spectacular this is to my mind a flawless production little details add much to the enjoyment the game similes scrooges nephew and wife play with their party guests is a neat item ive since recreated it with my high school english students as a brief respite from class work honestly i can think of few ways to entertain myself over the holidays i enjoy more than indulging in this cbs production which was originally sponsored by ibm incidentally its fun to watch the old tape with the original ibm commercials  which show just how much computers have evolved in 21 years amazing how things have changed bottom line a christmas carol is a timeless story and this rendition is a timeless classic enjoy  and god bless us every one
236,the master of movie spectacle cecil b de mille goes west using three legends of the old west as its protagonists they probably never metgary cooper is portraying wild bill hickockjames ellison as buffalo bill and jean arthur does make a nice calamity jane the story serves only for de mille to hang some marvelous action sequences on like the big indian attackscenes like that are extremely well doneif you dont mind the somewhat overthetop performances of the cast this is an very entertaining westernlook out for a very young anthony quinn essaying the role of an indian brave who participated at the battle of little big hornthis part got him at least noticed in hollywood
237,two women sick of their controlling husbands taking a vacation in italy for a month with two other very different womenthey come back refreshed and energized in this wonderful little film by merchant  ivorygreat scenery and the location isnt bad either seriously a very good period piece 7 of 10
238,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting the writing was topnotch james arness is a great actor and he showed it here brian keith was too old to be davy crockett and can anyone really play davy but fess parkeranother great actor in this move was raul julia who gave depth to santa anna a vain and complex person who led mexico through turbulent timeswhile some may think the movie was slowpaced it captured the battle as it unfolded lots of tedium followed by a couple hours of horrific terrorwhat impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in in this day and age when nobody stands for anything i found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom no matter how you may feel about the politics of the time
239,this version of the charles dickens novel features george c scott as the scrooge fine casting especially the choice of scott who plays the role to the hilta fine cast supports him in the very good adaption a modern day holiday classic on a scale of one to ten9
240,i liked this movie a lot it really intrigued me how deanna and alicia became friends over such a tragedy alicia was just a troubled soul and deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot my only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things other than that it was great
241,julian noble pierce brosnan is a hitman or a facilitator of fatalities as he prefers to be called he is also a drunk a womaniser and in the middle of a midlife crisis on a job in mexico city he bumps into danny white greg kinnear an unconfident businessman who thinks hes just nailed a recent pitch but is unsure they meet in the hotel bar late one night after theyve both had a few too many margaritassounds like the setup for a bythenumbers comedy thriller doesnt it but it isnt instead the matador is a funny and sometimes touching character study it avoids every twist that the above summary would suggest sometimes even setting them up just to gleefully tear them down it is a film that respects it characters enough to just let them get on with it without feeling the need to shove them into needless plot contrivancesbrosnans hitman will inevitably be compared to his bond but this is unfair to both performances bond is a halfformed idea a product of all that has gone before while julian is a fullyformed character with his own motivations and flaws he has existed in his own shadowy seedy world for so long that he has forgotten how to talk to another human beingwhen he meets danny in the hotel bar he sees his opposite a normal guy with a normal job and normal problems he envies danny the hitman has become fed up with his life sees himself edging ever closer to his inevitable burn out as he puts it but when danny opens up about the death of his only son julian tries to change the subject with a dirty joke he is a man who has in his own words been running from any emotion kinnear holds his own opposite brosnans performance and injects danny white with his effortless everyman charm he is the perfect foil to julian while the latter is drunken bravado and hedonism danny is down to earth with just a hint of eccentricity but he too goes deeper than his established persona showing us how far the everyman will go when faced with financial and familial ruinthere is real chemistry between brosnan and kinnear it is most visible in the films three key scenes the hotel bar a bullfight during which julian tells danny what he does for a living and takes him through a dress rehearsal of an assassination and a scene in which julian turns up at dannys house six months later this scene also introduces us properly to dannys wife bean yes bean in another example of how much the matador respects its characters bean hope davis instead of panicking at the presence of a hired killer in her house merely asks with forced calm did you bring your gun the script isnt quite as good as could have been after maybe another rewrite one or two lines seem a little forced and a couple of the jokes need a little more work but in the scenes where julian and danny and later bean just talk the writing is superb the film feels no need to put the characters in any outlandish situations other than meeting a hitman and said hitman turning up on your doorstep it just lets them talk gently nudging them toward necessary plot pointsthere is action but only when it reflects on the characters one notable instance is when julian botches a job in budapest because he keeps seeing himself through his rifles scope the rest of the film is about the characters how they interact how they each affect one another and ultimately it is about friendship even in the most unlikely of places at one point julian tells danny that he is his only friend and he really means it
242,i first heard about this film about 20 years ago when i was a kid in grade school it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day and under the entry for movies or cinema i dont remember were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental and one of them shown on the page was a still for offon it really intrigued me since it stood out the most on the page it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over itabout 18 or so years later the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole 4dvd set of treasures of american film archives released by the national film preservation foundation so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs after all these years i could finally see the film after viewing it it slightly wasnt was i was expecting it to be it tended to be a more organiclooking film not that thats a bad thing but i was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic but it was still an impressive film imho considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film including handtinting the film itself and using video equipment for some of the films scenes filmed off of a video monitor giving it a more distressed lores lookdont get me wrong the techniques used in this film were quite groundbreaking for 1972 thats why its still one of my favorite shortexperimental films and a creative inspiration for me as well
243,la maman et la putain is the beautifulest film of all time and whats most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with which is directly inspired by prousts a la recherche du temps perduindeed la maman et la putain and in search of lost time apparently tell the same story  the one of the failure of love which repeats itself endlessly the first womans name is always gilberte and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of gilberte  veronika is like a whore gilberte beautiful like the night whereas gilberte was pure and beautiful like the day after the failure of the first love a second love begins but this one is like already doomed by the first one veronika takes the place of gilberte in alexandres life and in the movie she progressively eclipses her first by time to time gilbertes still coming when alexandre waits for veronikathen totally that shows its the same sad story repeating itself the same unfaithful woman like alexandre says who appears endlessly  and unfaithful is for proust the higher point in love which makes it exist but which also underlines its illusionsart is what causes the passage between whats outside  the illusion of love  to whats inside which is the truth and is a learning of this truth for instance when veronika notices the strange way alexandre makes is bed he answers that he saw it in a movie and then that a movie its made for that to learn how to live how to make a bed alexander wants to live like he was in a film he wants his life to be art this conception of art comes from proust with whom eustache shares the same rejection of political art and realism in art la maman et la putain fights against a conception of art principaly political  see for example the ironical review of a political movie by alexandre like proust says  art doesnt care for all this proclamations and only exists in silence first of all art is introspection and that also why realism or naturalism is rejected  art needs to transform reality to exist proust writes  i discover the illusion of realism which is a lie thats why la maman et la putain doesnt hide its artificiality underlines by the way the actors say their text  the more you seem artificial the higher you go said eustacheeustache and proust both share this idea that the artist is a translater of a inner truth but alexandre failed where eustache succeed la maman et la putain tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is you can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie which becomes saddest you can see it in the face of alexandre who looks more and more like a livingdead you can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer and that after a while nothing happens outside at the end of the movie when you see alexandre writing and veronika asking if hes writing his lifeyou can guess that hes not that even literature failed the end of the movie shows the symbolic death of alexander who is smashes by the heaviness of reality and in this tiny nurses room alexandre looks more like albertine than marcelto explain this failure we can say that alexandre is a balzacs reader in forme et signification jean rousset explains that in prousts the readers of balzac who are swann and charlus are unable of any artistic creation because theyre stuck in reality which they mistake with art they see reality in art and are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work between reality and art and thats exactly alexandre he claims for instance that he loves a woman for parallel reasons because she played in a bressons for example hes like swann who falls in love with odette because she looks like a botticellis womanlife is perhaps not my vocation this thought is indeed by eustache who committed suicide even if its said by alexandre nevertheless there is a difference between alexandre and eustache  if eustache is absolutely alexandre alexandre is like a double without art a horrible vision of the artist which crystallizes his fearsby fallowing veronika at the end of the movie alexandre is condemned to illusions its death that remind me the last frames of the movie in the face of jeanpierre léaud as well as in the endless pucking of veronika or maybe it is already hell that describes the end like in sartes huitclot and absolutely not like in the final liberation of le temps retrouvé if eustache had read proust alexandre could never have finish the book  always perturbed by life and veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the cafés la maman et la putain is like a inverse double of in search of lost times which tells how alexander doesnt become an artist whereas a la recherche du temps perdu tells how marcel becomes a writer genetteif like baudelaire says an artiste tells reality at the light of his dream it is his nightmare that eustache tells us in la maman et la putain
244,i have to admit that tsui hark is one of a kind you cant top a person with a strong style of movie presence a chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to an audience the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of zu mountain and this is what he displayedthe new legend of zu has truly improved from the one in 1983 from this new millenium update we could see tsui harks vision of the zu mountains spectacular visual designs amazing actionfantasy epic made beautifully well kept me glued through the entire picture great cast with just fine acting its truly a fun movie to watch but is it too weirdnow the down side is people will definitely get confused with its broad story line shortened down into a 95 minute movie plot may not have much relation among characters but by rewatching the movie youll have a better sense of understanding the characters itself some can complain there isnt too much physical combat besides with characters that have supernatural powers to defeat foes spirits fighting by handtohand wouldnt really make sense at all i appreciated this nice stylish picture it may have a thin story but hey look at tsui harks time  tide we got confused by the plot as well but it was truly something stylish and awesome tsui hark always attracts something different into hk cinema american audiences may have some difficulty to understand while watching this movie cause this aint no crouching tiger hidden dragon this is a whole new genre although it may not be a masterpiece but its special effects is truly better than storm riders this is really worth checking out
245,one of the things about the film that warmed my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene i have occasionally carried out my times of dry fly fishing having tied my own flies and being accompanied by my brother and my father we spend a day on one river or another seeking to tempt the ever elusive brown trout to rise and take the fly that has been offered to themwhen we had occasions like this any differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and the surroundings of the place we were inthis was one of the amazing things that was portrayed to me in the film as the minister and his two sons norman and pauly carried out the ritual for there is something ritualistic about fly fishing as there is something ritualistic about so many pastimes you cant just start casting your fishing line and hope for the best you have to attune yourself to the place you are in you have to scan the surface of the water considering how it is flowing and where the best point might be to place your fly and depending on your skill level you might even get your fly to land there long enough for a fish to take note of it and strike the art of flyfishing was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artiststhe title for the film could not be more aptly chosen for the river did in fact run through the life of father and two sons this film however spreads itself broader than the family and community in montana by the the blackfoot river where the film is played out it has the capacity to draw you in to enthrall you to capture you as the history of the family community and period is unfolded the story told is not just a family history but a history of life what may be classified as a river of life
246,i remember seeing this when it was released in a theater in palo alto and not expecting much i mean  an australian movie but it finally got to me heres a scene richard chamberlain is sitting cross legged on the floor of a shabby apartment in sidney facing an australian aborigine elder named charliechamberlain you were outside my house last night you frightened my wife who are you and charlie at a deliberate pace replies who are you who are you who are you who are you who are you    are you a fish are you a snake are you a man     who are you who are you who are you its a stunning scene shot all in close ups with chamberlains blandly handsome face filling the screen in opposition to charlies black broadnosed bearded visagethe two guys couldnt be more different and this film is the story of how chamberlain accidentally stumbles from his humdrum lawyerly existence into the inexplicable almost unspeakable mysteries of charlies worldi dont think ill go on much about the plot its kind of an apocalyptic tale but i must say whoever did the research on australian aboriginal belief systems should get an a plus theyve got everything in here from pointing the bone to the dream time a kind of parallel universe in which dreams are real its an extremely spooky movie without any musical stings or splendiferous special effects charlys world simply begins to intrude into chamberlains dreams for reasons never made entirely clearif theres a problem with the script thats it nothing is ever made entirely clear does chamberlain who seems to have some extraordinary rapport with the aborigines die in the last wave do the aborigines does the entirety of sidney the basic premise is a little hard to accept too though granted that this is a fantasy the aborigines are invested with the kind of spiritual power that americans bestow on american indians whereas the fact is that mythology is mythology and while one may be more complex or satisfying  more elegant and beautiful if you like  mythology is still an attempt to transcend an ordinary demanding and sometimes disappointing physical existence the mysticism of charlie is more convincing that the miracles of moses in cecil b demilles the ten commandments but theyre brothers under the skinbut i dont care about that taken as a film this one is pretty good and its especially important for marking the celebrity of the director peter weir and the australian film industry this was the first of a great wave of films from the antipodes some of them raucous like mad max and some subtle and dramatic like lantana i like weirs stuff which resembles nicholas roegs in being pregnant with subliminal dread try picnic at hanging rock for an example of how to make a truly chilling movie with not a drop of blood
247,i was not expecting much from this movie i was given a ticket for an advanced screening i had just gotten off of work it was hot and i was tired i had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complexonce seated in the theater tired and frustrated the movie started i did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning but the flow of the movie was perfect right from the beginning i became consumed with the movie getting more and more excited with each minute passing i think this movie is destined to be a fantasyfairytale classic the actors were fabulous the pace was perfect and the ending was magical
248,one word supurrrrb i dont think i have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid tv schedule filled with reality shows and boring reruns i have to say i had my reservations after all critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading the show but when half an hour was over by the way thank you nbc for running a commercialfree show i was left with the feeling of instant love love at first glance the true love that one feels in his guts everything about this show screamed excellencegraphics in this show were at least as good as finding nemo and shrek no small feat considering those movies took years to be developedcast was marvelous i am partial to john goodmans voice but the rest of the team certainly were on par with john special mention lisa kudrows guest appearance she was on top of the game creating neurotic pudgy and lovable panda with a jewish streak in her panda from brooklyn only in this show script was funny with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp yet not tacky a note for all parents this is not for children this show was never advertised as such and theres a reason why its set for 9pm not 8pm so if youd like to complain about objectionable context save your breath adults deserve a comedy made just for them and father of the pride is it not everything was perfect i was a bit puzzled by siegfried and roys characters do i sense stereotype when it comes to them yes they are gay yes they are flamboyant yes they speak with german accents but thats yesterdays news give us something new something fresh something funny putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach i understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the star power that these guys have thats fine by me but please dont dwell on something everybody already knows by heart hopefully the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over in general the show is definitely a mustseetv funny witty with a few unexpected twists here and there  there havent been a comedy this good since seinfeld i am certainly looking forward to the next episode
249,a long time ago in a galaxy far far awaythere was a boy who was only two years old when the original star wars film was released he doesnt remember first seeing the movie but he also doesnt remember life before it he does remember the first star wars themed gift he gota shoebox full of action figures from the original set he was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be but years later he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts hes ever received another box full of action figures ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection its now legendary in this boys family how the last action figure he needed anakin skywalker stopped being produced and carried in stores and how this boy went for about ten years until he got into college trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets dont askits a northern illinois university thingi cant review star wars as a movie it represents absolutely everything good fun and magical about my childhood theres no separating it in my mind from christmases birthdays summers and winters growing up in the winter my friends and i would build snow forts and pretend we were on hoth i was always han solo my friends dad built them a kickass tree house and that served as the ewok village they also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it and this made a great spot to pretend we were in yodas home i am unabashedly dorky when it comes to star wars and i think people either just understand that or they dont i dont get the appeal of lord of the rings or star trek but i understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because i am a rabid fan of george lucass filmsi feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time every time i put them in the dvd player i feel like im eight years old again when life was simple and the biggest problem i had was figuring out how i was going to track down a figure of anakin skywalkergrade for the entire trilogy a
250,question how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers walther mathau in full furious and brilliant grumpy old man mode answer quietly deadpan and with perfect timing as george burns does herei know nothing of vaudeville but this remains a favourite film the two leads are hilarious the script funny the direction and pacing very fine richard benjamin is very funny as straight man  trying to get at burns through the window etc even the small parts are greatthere are so many funny scenes mathau messing up the commercial burns repeating his answers as if senilea delightenterrrrrr
251,this is one excellent sammo hung movie actually this is a great piece of hong kong action cinema the story tells the story of pedicab drivers in macao looking for love and getting mixed up w a vicious pimp the performances are excellent and the characters are all likable and welldefined the story is involving and has enough romance drama comedy and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes sammo hung proves here that hes probably the best fight choreographer in the business the action is simply amazing esp the fight w lau kar leung and the finale billy chow and sammo hung are amazing a must see for any fan of action
252,in a little town in montana two brothers grow up one of them is norman craig sheffer the other is paul brad pitt their father is reverend maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion and the lessons of flyfishing in this movie flyfishing represents life a littlethe story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen but about the message some things do happen though norman goes to dartmouth to study after six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named jessie emily lloyd and he is invited to teach in chicago paul has become a reporter and is known as the fishing reporter he is famous and it seems he has a nice life but he drinks a little too much and gambles too muchthe movie is very well directed it has a nice score and all of the actors are good the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography the mountains the woods and the river all look very beautiful if the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch fortunately there is more
253,in all honesty this series is as much a classic as television goes as the original poem is to the worlds literature far from being crassly exploitative it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western cultures defining textsi was moved by the plight of odysseus and his followers touched by the drama of the fall of troy which was felt but not seen intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals it should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous cgi creatures flitting around on their ankle wings or poorlycast fashion models in bikinis as in homers work they act through mortal agents or rarely are represented by classical statuaryits a pity its not available in dvd especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the odyssey that one can find in video stores
254,i watched this movie alongwith my complete family of nine since my younger brother has recently got married we could connect with the goingson the movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple thankfully this time all indian locales like ranikhet almora etc have been used which have been already visited by most of the urbanites hence adding to the connection with movie the dialogues are much better than those in the umrao jaan ada  a supposedly dialogue based movie the background music is augmenting the soft focus of the movie it somehow remind me of vv chopras kareeb in which neha and to some extent bobby did full justice to the character same here in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any departmentlooks or acting the supporting cast are too good i rate the actress playing the role of bhabhi in the front league the situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie however though i respect ravindra jain for his body of work from movies to ramayana i missed ram laxman badlyit had no double entendressivan category no bikinis no intrigue and no nonsense you would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if youre already or going to be soon engaged i want to express on candid thing here that though suraj proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals his approach is totally individualistic the movie is only about prem  poonam rest of the characters are incidental art immitating life the peripheral characters are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair coming back everything was almost great except for the drama part the situation of tragedy was artificially created the outcome the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all that is why it lacks the emotional punchthe very purpose of this turn of events but a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful premarital video to a feature film but i kept waiting for the punch and it never came the preaching by mohnish bahal and later by alok nath on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard may be this will help the movie a taxfree status but the plot could have been made more interesting and nonlinear than what it wasthere were too question in my mind when the movie ended 1 has the movie really ended 2 has the movie ended
255,as a study of the frailties of human nature in the context of old age this film is without parallel it is quite simply brilliant full marks to everyone  from the scriptwriter to all involved in the finished product you can only marvel at the perceptions inherent in the characterisation of the two ageing performers
256,after the failure of the crusades at the box office cecil b demille stopped doing films about nonamerican history his films for the next thirteen years were about our history from jean lafitte to world war ii dr wassell the first in order of production was this film starring gary cooper as wild bill hickok with jean arthur as calamity jane james ellison was buffalo bill john miljan not a villain as usual was general george a custer and anthony quinn was one of the indians who fought at little big horn the villains were led by charles bickford selling arms to the indians and porter hall as jack mccall who killed wild bill hickokbasically the film takes up the history of the us after the civil war lincoln is shown at the start talking about what is the next step now that lee has surrendered lincoln talks about the need to secure the west more about this point later then he announces he has to go to the theater that april 14th must have been very busy for abe  in virginia city he grants a pardon to errol flynn at the request of miriam hopkins on the same dateactually while lincoln was concerned about the west his immediate thoughts on the last day of his presidency were about reunifying the former confederate states and its citizens into the union as soon as possible it was reconstruction that occupied his attention not the west except for the problems of maximillian and his french controlled forces in mexico against juarez but he had been involved in actual problems with the west in 1862 he sent disgraced general john pope the loser at second manassas to minnesota to put down a serious indian war by the sioux the subject of mckinley kantors novel sprit lake pope incompetent against lee and jackson turned out to be quite effective here and the revolt was smashedhowever with all lincolns actual attention to western problems it is doubtful that he says as cooper repeats at least once the frontier should be secure there is nothing to say he could not have said it but it is hardly a profound pronouncement by a leading statesman like saying teddy roosevelt said eat a good breakfast every morning for your health it is not a profound statement of policy it is at best a statement of recognizable fact cooper turning it into a minor mantra like lincolns version of the monroe doctrine is ridiculoustypical of the way demilles scripts have really bad errors of common sense in themhowever this is not a ruinous mistake the plainsman is an adventure film and as such it has the full benefit of demille the film creator of spectacle as such it is well worth watching but not as a textbook on lincolns political ideas or his quotable legacy
257,home room came as a total surprise not having a clue as to what it was all about it paid off big time because it doesnt hold any punches and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to victimize his class mates who are the innocent victims of his rash actionspaul ryan the director who is working and editing his own material is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his castalicia browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school she has been away a couple of years and doesnt seem to be in the same wave length of the other students for one she is a rebel with a punk look lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her orbit alicia was among the students in the home room where nine students have died supposedly killed by her boyfriend alicia we realize is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life but we are not given any clues to that effectwhat follows is the aftermath of the tragedy as it concentrates on a young woman who has survived it deanna cartwright is a wealthy teen ager who shouldnt have been at the school at all when a ricochet bullet hit her she is hospitalized with more than a wound she is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares dont let her forgetalicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal since she doesnt cooperate with the police the head of the school wants her to see deanna in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows alicia dislikes deanna but in a matter of days both girls will make peace we dont realize until the last sequence what really happened that horrible day in schoolbusy phillips makes an excellent alicia and erika christiansen is equally good as deanna victor garber james pinkins taylor holland and the rest of the cast play as an ensemblethe film has an intensity because its not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred which helps the tone that mr ryan wanted to give this movie
258,i happened across bait on cable one night just as it started and thought eh why not im glad i gave it a chance bait aint perfect it suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness but overall this movie worked all the elements aligned just right and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film most of that i think is due to jamie foxx i dont know who tagged foxx for the lead but whoever it was did this movie a big favor believable and amazingly likeable foxx glides through the movie smooth as butter and funnier than hell you can tell hes working on instinct and instinct doesnt fail himthe plot while unimportant actually ties together pretty well and theres even a character arc through which foxxs character grows as a person again they couldve slipped by without any of this but it just makes things that much betterim surprised at the low rating for this maybe i just caught this move on the right night or vice versa but id give it a 710 bravo mssr foxx
259,after losing his cattle herd to a dishonest lawman a trail boss winds up in the yukon gold fields with a bad reputation and small chances of being able to return to the states while there his fortunes take a turn for the best until a bad luck specter from the past comes calling good western with many favorite old faces in the lineup
260,where was this film when i was a kid after his parents split up tadashi moves with his mom to live his his grandfather tadashis sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone grandfather is only here every third day moms never really home the kids always are picking on the poor kid during a village festival tadashi is chosen the kirin rider or spiritual champion of the peace and justice little does he suspect that soon he will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual worldokay that was the easy part now comes the hard part trying to explain the filmthis is a great kids film no this is a great filmflawed very flawed but a great film none the less it unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as tadashi struggles to find the strength to become a hero watching it i felt i was reading a great book and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book i loved that the film does not follow a normal path things often happen out of happenstance or through miscommunication one character gets sucked into events simply because his foot falls asleep there are twists and turns and moments that seem like non sequiters and are all the more charming for it which is typical miike certainly its a takashi miike film that japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching scary and funny all at the same time no one except miike seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next i admire the fact that miike has made a film that is bleak and hopeful that doesnt shy away from being scary i mean really scary especially for kids this is the same dark territory that should be in the harry potter movies but rarely is this a dark grimms tale with humor my first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that i couldnt believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the end of the world then i realized who was making the movie hats off to miike for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening imagesits also operating on more than one level the mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankinds discarded junk its the rage of being thrown away that fuels the monstersone of the yokai spirits talks about the rage sneakers thrown away because they are dirty or too small feels when they are tossed you also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do its a wild concept but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level there are a good many riffs and references to other moviestv shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not understand them though many parents will and of course there are the monsters they run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen its way cool and it works one of the main characters is a yokai which i think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment he rides on tadashis head acceptance is also easier if youve ever seen the old woodcuts of the weird japanese monsters i mentioned flaws and there are a few the effects are uneven some of the sudden turns are a bit odd even if understandable and a few other minor things which are fading now some two hours after watching the film none of them truly hurt the film over all however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the moviei really loved this movie im pretty sure that if i saw this as a kid it would have been my favorite film of all time wheres the english dubsee this movie its a great trip besides its a good introduction to the films of miike minus the blood and graphic sex
261,i disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as just entertainment set right after the carefree roaring 20s during the early days of the great depression dance fools dance is at its heart an earnest cautionary tale with a clear message about how best to endure these hard times yet this fastpaced and tightlyplotted film is far from being a dreary morality talein the 30s hollywood had a knack for churning out one entertaining and enlightening audiencepleaser after another all without wasting a frame of film dance fools dance  one of four films that harry beaumont directed in 1931  is barely 80 minutes long yet its characters are well developed its story never seems rushed and despite its many twists in plot the audience is never left behindwith the lone exception of lester vail as flaccid love interest bob townsend the supporting cast is uniformly strong worthy of note are william bakewell as crawfords brother cliff edwards best known as the voice of jiminy cricket as reporter bert scranton and clark gable in an early supporting role as gangster jake luvabut this is joan crawfords film and she absolutely shines in it made when she was just 27 this lesserknown version of crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work however here is proof that long before she took home an oscar for mildred pierce crawford was a star in the true sense of the word a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herselfscore eight out of ten
262,i guess when beat street made a national appearance flashdance came at the same time the problem with flashdance is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet that was one of the reasons why beat street was better the only movie that could rival beat street seems to be footloose because both movies focused on how dance had been used by people to express their utmost feelingsthe breakdance scenes in beat street come just before the middle and at the end of the flick and i loved all of them almost all of the break tricks were featured in the break jam scenes the jackhammer the flares the head spins the suicide sit the crazy legs the mortal the forward flip the figure fouralmost everythinglike the warriors beat street does have violence related to the gang life in the hip hop worldbut in a much less violent way than the former the only major fight scene in beat street was when graffiti artist ramon which in the movie was abbreviated as ramo is chased by a rival gang member on the new york city subway tracksfighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail well although that chase scene ended tragically it was better that they died that way than having blood exploding from a gang gunshotmost of the gang stuff in the flick was graffiti related to the hiphop culture and rap music a lot of rap music appeared in the flick because hiphop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life even the theme song of the movie which closed the curtain to the flick was not just an homage to hiphop cultureit also was an homage to the death of ramonby the way during the dance scene called tango tango i guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress rae dawn chong was sheila e making a cameo appearance
263,i think this has the potential of being the best star trek series yet i say potential we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas but i hope not for those that have not seen itsee it without that annoying prime directive floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool and scott bakula was without a doubt a great choice for captain and the vulcan babe is hot too check out the decontamination scenei gave this a full 10 it blows away all the other series openers i hope this goes longer than 7 years
264,greetings again from the darkness this one will be compared to the princess bride and although it doesnt measure up to that classic it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right the story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained but the execution is fine even building up strong suspensecharlie cox plays tristan who falls for the wrong girl sienna miller and agrees to fetch her a fallen star  who happens to be played by the stunning claire danes not much suspense on what happens with these two but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by michelle pfeiffer and the prince son of king peter otoole looking to reclaim the ruby necklace our star is wearing lots of bad chasing the goodalong the way an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see including any from the carribbean robert deniro plays captain shakespeare  tough on the inside and shall we say in touch with his feminine side another encounter involves the brilliant ricky gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughsnot your typical chase coming of age or fantasy film but director matthew vaughns layer cake effort deserves an audience sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money my guess it will find big success on video
265,i just came back from hong kong on my summer vacation and saw the legend of zu i thought it kicked as it was so creative and unique its the crouching tiger hidden dragon with a lot less drama even if some thought there was too much special fxyeah right you cant complain about the cast zhang ziyi and cecilia cheung are so fine the legend of zukicks as
266,another very good mann flick thanks to the fatherson combination of walter brennan and jimmy stewart brennan ben tatum is often the comedic conscience of either stewart or wayne red river rio bravo hes there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend youre wrong mr dunston jeff websterstewart gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert brennan john mcintire is excellent as the law of skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people the loner can do neither and suffers for itthe caption above plays on tatums assertion that he cant live without his coffee this nicotine addiction proves fatal probably the first and last time on the screeni recommend this film and now own the dvd
267,i knew about this as a similar programme as jackass and i saw one or two episodes on freeview and it is the same only more extreme basically three welsh guys and one mad british bloke were brought together by love of skateboarding and a complete disregardmasochistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety they have had puking eating pubescovered pizza jumping in stinging nettles naked paint balling jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleepingsnoring stunts in a work place eg army cowboys and many more insane stunts that cause bruises bumps blood and vomit maybe not just for themselves starring matthew pritchard who does pretty much anything lee dainton also up for just about anything dan joyce the british one who hardly does much physical stuff and has a ott laugh and pancho mike locke who does a lot but is more popular for being short fat and lazy it was number something on the 100 greatest funny moments very good
268,as a psychiatrist specialized in trauma i find this film a beautiful shown example of a severe psychic trauma even a trauma it not only explains the enormous difficulties those people have to cope wither but that even love is sometimes not enough but she tries
269,i dont know how or why this film has a meager rating on imdb this film accompanied by i am curious blue is a masterworkthe only thing that will let you down in this film is if you dont like the process of film dont like psychology or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic rammingthis isnt a film that you will want to watch to unwind its a film that you want to see like any other masterpiece with time attention and caresummaries may contain a spoiler or twothe main thing about this film is that it blends the whole film within a film thing but it does it in such a way that sometimes you forget that the fictions arent realthe film is like many films in one1 a political documentary about the social system in sweden at the time which in a lot of ways are still relevant to today interviews done by a young woman named lena2 a narrative about a filmmaker vilgot sjoman making a film he deals with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should have never got involved with people hes supposed to work with3 the film that vilgot is making its about a young woman named lenaie 2 who is young and very politically active she is making a documentary ie 1 she is also a coming of age and into her sexuality and the freedom of thatthe magnificence and sheer brilliance of i am curious yellowblue is how these three elements are cut together in one moment you are watching an interview about politics and the next your watching what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes but does that so well that you sometimes forget that it is the narrativeanother thing is the dynamic between yellow and blue which if you see one you must see the other blue is not a sequel at all ill try to explain it best i can because to my knowledge no other films have done it though it is a great techniquethink of yellow as a living thing actual events in 14 scenes a complete talethink of blue as all the things in between the 14 scenes in yellow that you didnt see that is a complete tale on its ownessentially they are parallel films the same story told in two different waysit wasnt until i saw the first 30 minutes of blue that i fully understood yellowi hope this was helpful for people who are being discouraged by various influences because this film changed the way i looked at filmthanks for your time
270,embarrassingly i just watched this movie for the first time 13 years after its release its a story that any father or brother can relate to one brother is a bit wild the other brother is the typical older child craig sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother but pitt is amazing and skerritt is perfectly cast as the father the fishing scenes that were filmed in montana are absolutely breathtaking i had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive the movie closely follows the book with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format unlike most book to movie stories this one measures up its a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie
271,greetings again from the darkness much anticipated twisted comedy from writerdirector richard shepard is a coming out party for pierce brosnan the actor that bond guy is gone this new guy is something else entirely have read that shepard thought brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role but brosnan proves to be the perfect julian noble facilitator  and is anything but pretty do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one if you go expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex killing religion sports business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements even sitting on a hotel bed with or without a sombrero is a joy to beholdgreg kinnear is the straight guy to brosnans comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click hope davis has a small but subtly effective supporting role as kinnears wife whats with her name bean who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living roomthe visuals and settings are perfect  including a bullfight racetrack and denver suburb and how often do we get the killers and xavier cugat on the same soundtrack this one is definitely not for everyone but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy risky filmmaking it could be for you
272,sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment most demille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip the story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments the action takes us from an indian raid on a cabin one of the best parts of the movie with jean arthur excellent while attempting to appease the warpainted natives this is followed by her and cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured later comes a protracted battle with the cheyenne the whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish jean arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here
273,i gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes this is definitely really about a 55 ummm it was kind of bloody had likeable shallow characters and it had some really hot babes in it i like the eclectic killer because he didnt kill people the same way everytime that sometimes gets old
274,filmed just after the war this story was made in order to highlight angloamerican relations after the war it ended up receiving the honour of being the first royal premiere after wwiiremarkably the film tangles together the royal air force sigmund freud psychology the founding fathers of america and various others up the long stairs special effects in its infancy and beyond the heavenly gates without losing any of its integrity although sounding absurd this clever script leads and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the skill of a mountain goat and a presents a charming ease rarely matched in cinema since be prepared to have your heart warmed by this sweet innocent and charming love story roger livesey acts like a man possessed to steal the show british cinema should cry when it remembers how good it used to be in those early post war years
275,this is one of joan crawfords best talkies it was the first gablecrawford pairing and made it evident to mgm and to audiences that they were a sizzling team leading the studio to make seven more films with them as costarsthe film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a brother and sister who after their father loses everything in the stock market crash must fend for themselves and work for a living life is hard in the depression and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove futile and they resort to underworld activity joan crawford is excellent as the socialiteturnedmoll shes smart complex and believable she even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other actors early talkie acting style clark gable is a diamondinthe rough masculine and gruff as the nononsense gangster who becomes involved with crawfords character the same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite norma shearer in a free soul securing his position as top male sex symbol at mgmif you like crawford in this type of role dont miss paid which she did a year earlier which is also among her best early talkie performances
276,bromwell high is a cartoon comedy it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life such as teachers my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell highs satire is much closer to reality than is teachers the scramble to survive financially the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers pomp the pettiness of the whole situation all remind me of the schools i knew and their students when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school i immediately recalled  at  high a classic line inspector im here to sack one of your teachers student welcome to bromwell high i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched what a pity that it isnt
277,telemundo should definitely consider making a dvd collection of the novela xica i know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela xica it is a very entertaining novela which is set in brazil the costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful xica contains a lot of history of that time period i wish telemundo would televise it again even if it was a 2 in the morning i would highly recommend watching xica if it is ever shown again on telemundo ive emailed telemundo a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears the only cautionary statement about xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore i would recommend that children under 14 do not watch xica overall xica merits a 10 out of 10
278,it all begins with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated objects in a hostel for students on hickory road london concerned for her sister who is the housekeeper there miss lemon asks hercule poirot to look into the matter he agrees but soon the stakes get higher when a girl who had admitted that she was responsible for most not all of the thefts is found murderedhickory dickory dock is a solid brain exercise without being as mindnumbingly complicated as one two buckle my shoe murder theft and diamond smuggling are the crimes involved and the final twist that ties everything together is revealed only in the last 2 minutes the characters are interesting particularly the psychology student colin mcnabb and the mysterious american girl sally finch inspector japp has his funny moments in perhaps the closest this series has come to toilet humor and miss lemon gets a more integral part to the story than usual 
279,one of my all time favourite films ever just beautiful full of human emotion wit humour intelligence the story grows as does the lesson of life just a wonderful film in so many waysthe cast are also fantasic a great selection of the finest british talent around i loved them all for every diverse element brought into the filmitaly has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this  everything about this film works i love it 
280,crush examines female friendship for the most part avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many films with the same theme e g steel magnolias at the same time it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise the events depicted were highly improbable but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me not a film for the speedingvehicleandexplosion crowd but grownup women are certain to respond with both laughter and tears
281,i wanted to see valentine ever since i saw that denise richards and marley shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever when i watched valentine i was amazed at how great the story line actually was it kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all the actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor and i admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring but overall it was nonstop entertaining and suspenseful it had a mindtwisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesnt deserve all the crap it gets i recommend this movie to watch anytime but especially on valentines day because its sure to give you a ton of chills oh and dont even pay attention to the trailer or rating please dont
282,i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while sometimes i felt as though i would just want someone to die stanleys killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird judd nelson is cute at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell brilliant movie
283,from rainy dreary late winter england of early 1920swhere there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled vets from the great slaughter of men and killer of their womens dreams known now as world war ifour women share this lovely small sunny italian castle on a hill one a young widow who is drowning her sorrow in frantic partying two women who will rediscover their own husbands and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friendsthese four women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier  almost blind  to get a spiritual makeover for one great april vacation in early 1920s italynote to wouldbe filmmakers study this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story probably not a film to please many mennote stock up on coffee  hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter dayspring is comingenchanted april promises you
284,this is a movie that has a lot of things that only japanese people can understand even well translated there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism my guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort but that just got wasted on mewhat i felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects some kid becomes the one and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway it would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about but between the azumi bean washing yokai and the one that looks like a big tongued umbrella rihanna eat your heart out i couldnt really discern the plotbottom line nice visuals the kid screams a lot the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap
285,this was the first movie that joan crawford and clark gable made together and they would go on to make several more crawford stars a young rich girl whos father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother they have never worked before and the brother william bakewell gets a job with gable who is a gangster and bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on their is a massacre in which several of gables men are killed and crawford was a witness to the whole thing its a good movie but not one of their best
286,im a fan of tv movies in general and this was one of the good ones the cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists i didnt see coming before each commercial to me it was kind of like medium meets csidid anyone else think that in certain lights the daughter looked like a young nicole kidman are they related in any way id definitely watch it agin or rent it if it ever comes to videodedee was great havent seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very convincinglyif youre into to tv mystery movies check this one out if you have a chance
287,fortunately for us real mccoy fans most likely all baby boomers who grewup in the late 50s and 60s three of the adult actorsactress appeared when they did for the reunion show in 2000 tony martinez and richard crenna both died shortly thereafter as enjoyable as it was to see luke sugarbabe and pepino together again it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of lydia reed and michael winkleman it is my understanding that little luke had passed away in 1999 but im not sure how there is no information about hassie on the internet that i can find very curious why they were not even mentioned it was so conspicuous their absence from the reunion show that i suspect that the family of michael and lydia herself if still alive either 1 requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted or 2 tnn could not find any trace of either michael or lydia like the rest of us they seemed to have vanished therefore it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all togetherotherwise the retrospect on walter brennen was wonderfully done they made no bones about it  it was grandpa who made the show such a success i remember as a child mimicking grandpas gimp walk and my parents laughing as im sure a million other children did back then one annoyance that did bother me a bit was the tendency for richard crenna to dominate the discussion  at times interrupting tony and kathleen to make a point in fact although tony martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation he was not allowed to speakout and say too much during the reunion show unfortunate since i wanted to hear from all three equally all in all the reunion show was a real treat for me ive watched it on dvd several times and have enjoyed it each timedodgerdude
288,actually this movie was not so bad it contains action comedy and excitement there are good actors in this film for instance doug hutchison percy from the green mile who plays bristol another well known actor is jamie kennedy from scream and three kings the main characters are played by jamie foxx as alvin who was pretty good and also funny but the one who most surprised me was david morse as edgar clenteen he plays a different character than he usually does because in other films like the green mile indian runner the negotiator or the langoliers he plays a very sympathetic person and in bait the plays almost the opposite a man without any emotions which was nice to see the only really negative thing about this film are the several pictures of the world trade center which makes this film perhaps look a little dated overall i thought this was a pretty good little film
289,i loved this movie it was almost the same as the first cabin by the lake only instead of just killing women he kills men also and the scenes are much more interesting 2 of my favorite scenes are firstly when stanley and allison are in the dance club and he is describing kimberlys last moments before she is thrown to the water and secondly when stanley is visiting allison in his basement right before they head down to the set when she kisses him those scenes for me were very intense and riveting i gave the movie a rating of 810 not because the movie was bad but because the filming was bad i mean there were times when youd notice nothing was wrong like its being shot the way a film is usually shot you wouldnt see the live camera shooting but then very little you would notice the filming mistakes what went wrong
290,show people is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl peggy pepper whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen though shes a success in comedy what she wants to do is make art so she moves up to high arts studio soon she becomes patricia pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billymany stars of the silent era have cameos in show people including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup im sure when people saw the film in 1928 they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene sadly nowadays its not the case even for film buffs in one part of the film however she does meet charlie chaplin in another author elinor glyn is pointed out to her and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film other stars who pop up in show people are john gilbert douglas fairbanks william s hart leatrice joy bess flowers renee adoree rod laroque aileen pringle and many othersdavies was adorable and a lively comedienne its a shame william haines quit the movies  he was cute and energetic deservedly an enormous star back in the dayshow people is a simple story told in a witty way its also a look back at an exciting era in hollywoods history and contains performances by two wonderful stars
291,i am amazed at how this movieand most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on imdb the fanboy mentality strikes again when this movie came out just about everyone slammed it even my exgirlfriend said this movie questionable years later i sat down to watch this movie and i found myself enjoying even laughing quite a bit this and the replacement killers are the movies that had people labeling the director antoine fuqua as the black michael bay i dont see how since most of fuquas movies are smarter than anything michael bay has came up with at any ratestory alvin sandersjamie foxx is former convict that is used by a nononsense treasury agent edgardavid morse as a pawn to catch a killer named bristoldoug hutchinson alvins every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident while these agents are after bristol bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awryjamie foxx is funny as well as great as alvin sanders alvin is a fasttalker that is a lot smarter than he lets on doug hutchinson is okay as bristol he can be overthetop sometimes in his john malkovitchesque demeanor he was better here than he was as looney bin jim in punisher war zone david morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent even mike epps is funny as alvins brother stevie both him and jamie had some funny moments on screenthe only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat the scenario at the horse race track is way overthetop but i couldnt look away the director went all out there so he gets points for that plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty niftyall in all bait is not a bad movie by a long shot its never boring its always funny and i wasnt checking my watch every minute that should count for something bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 periodps to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent how long have you been living under a rock im pretty sure youve seen the die hard series and every movie by quentin tarantino but those movies arent violent right weirdo
292,my wife kate and i absolutely loved the series and cant wait for the next one hopefully there is a sequel i would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it maybe because i am old and grey and still interested in life if anyone has the full lyrics please send themof course one big reason why my wife and i liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually its great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience the human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the showthis series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated on a par with some of our other favourites spooks and hustle
293,the summer has been so full of blockbusters and comebacks of films and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks that i was woe to find a film i could just sit down and enjoy in case you dont want to read further down the page there arent any spoilers ill sum it up here its more mature than ella enchanted there are some questionably violent parts plenty of death and a handful of scenes with a little blood not for small children but doesnt try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds think of it as a bit more serious bit more magical princess bride and youll be close i am perhaps not as prodigious a movie goer as others maybe once or twice a month if i feel active im also a huge scififantasy fan i get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10 and this film is the diamond in the roughby the end here august i was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that i averted seeing bourne ultimatum in favor of stardust having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by transformers for my fiction addiction the previews of stardust seemed appealing but i was certainly waryas many others here i was utterly surprised i had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichéd from here to breakfast dont be fooled it is most definitely a fairytale and it does indeed have witches magic and utterly requires suspension of disbelief but the most refreshing thing i found is that its not based on anything ive seen or read in the past 15 years and its actually a really good movieunlike 90 of the other movies which seem to persistently reappear like thorns in a side perhaps a sign that hollywood is running out of ideas i could read a book this year and in two years the movie would be out as another epic fantasy tale the likes of lotr and the rest so says the nyt and such and such no doubtstardust didnt have me bolted to my seat because of jampacked action at every turn nor was i sweating bullets because of plothook after plothook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom it didnt even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to whats happening on screen transformers im looking at you its not trying to show off the latest cgi techniques nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough i couldve figured them out in 3rd grade boy i hate those i just watched watched and enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline unfold before my eyes sure i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film but it makes you forget that it even made my heart twinge at some parts but the most important aspect i noticed is that i left the theater feeling better than when id gone init truly is a gem after so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work id done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my moneys worthits probably not for everyone but do yourself a favor if you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone princess bride black cauldron the dark crystal etc then you should really see this movie this little diamond is finding its way into my dvd collection the moment it hits stores you can trust me on thissimply wonderful
294,classic dramaaction western with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of its time1954 the production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and loveunique peek into the american northt west pioneers is very educational and entertainingthis movie is very under rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many lawmen during this particular time and place were very crookedcorrupt much like most developing countries todaythe action sequences could have been more realistic though but stillthis movie really covers most of the essentialsnot for an audience who wants only pure testoterone type westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy
295,ho ho homicidal maniac this spirited tourdeforce adaptation of a great ec comics horror tale is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable tv series ever made director robert back to the future zemeckis makes the most out of a witty script by fred night of the creeps the monster squad dekker which centers on a ruthless twotiming housewife well played by mary ellen trainor who was married to zemeckis when she starred in this episode who kills her jilted jerk of a husband a nice cameo by marshall bell on christmas eve by whacking him upside the head with a firepoker complications ensue when a deranged murderous madman dressed up as jolly kris kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit alan silvestris spooky stirring score and dean cundeys typically polished cinematography further enhance the macabre fun and larry drake the sweet gentle giant benny on la law with his creepy hiccuping guffaw a demented twinkle in his bright green eyes and a leering truly wicked grin makes for a sensational sanguinary saint nick
296,this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year a few too many coincidences and plot holes however we are talking about a movie where a hitman and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldnt come as too much of a surprise brosnan is excellent in this role gone is the wooden james bond a role he was wasted in if he can maintain this kind of quality i hope he continues to make comedies greg kinnear is also excellent as brosnans straight man ive read a few negative comments in here about hope davis but i thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where i nearly died laughing my father a consultant nearly lost it when julian describes himself as a facilitator much like grosse pointe blank another hitman comedy the humour can be very dark if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself
297,french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary everyday suburban life this was readily apparent with the release early in 2002 of lemploi du temps  time out   a brilliant character study of of a white collar workers descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job as is the penchant of french filmmakers  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places giving a cinema verite feel to the story  yet lemploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production jacques audiards gritty crime caper sur mes levres  read my lips  actually to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that as with the earlier french release it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them in a paris construction firm carla a shy diminutive young woman sits at her desk sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restroomsobnoxious coworkers use the front of carlas desk to chat and drop off their halffinished styrofoam cups of coffee partially deaf carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friends baby when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load carla fears she may lose her job at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant preferably male as if she were at a personals agency he should be 25 years old and clean cut  with extensive computer and filing skills when the agency sends over an unkempt  menacing looking young man carla is both shocked and intrigued they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery where carla interviews her prospective assistant when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul but has a change of heart and hires him on although she is basically kind toward her helper carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips later when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on a furious carla asks pauls help in seeking revenge on the man from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock most notably rear window where carlas lipreading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars there is a teasing onagain offagain sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars that being said what one carries away from this movie isnt so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers although those elements are definitely there but the pervasive view a of a modern day city in this case paris where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy garish nightlife where sex drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters unlike hollywood productions this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared its hitchcock with the gloves off
298,the sunshine boys is a terrific comedy about two exvaudevillians who reluctantly reunite for a tv special despite the fact that they despise each otherthe comic genius of two masters at work george burns and walter matthau are stellar some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting over the silliest little trivial things the material is fastpaced and witty appealing to all agesmild spoiler alert there are some mildly sad moments toward the end of the movie that deal indirectly with the affects of aging that gives the film a soft sincere tenderness that shows to this reviewer that what the pair really need the most for success are each otherif anyone loves the odd couple youll adore this movie an excellent film
299,i watched this film not expecting much and not knowing anything much about it i loved it a very good tight plot an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly fat deaf girl and the excon and a pace that kept things flowing without being hurried a much much better film than the same directors de battre mon coeur sest arreté which was boring and unbelievablethe only thing that didnt quite work was that the supposedly ugly fat girl was neither ugly nor fat solid certainly and far from conventionally beautiful but with so much character in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on it superb i wish she was in more films and better ones than she generally is ive seen a bit of gilles wife and a bit of the moustache and they both looked like rubbish and ive seen all of de battre mon coeur sest arreté and that certainly is rubbish she seems to have a few coming up so ill keep my fingers crossed
300,rating 1010 master piecesome years ago i heard spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance well mr spielberg i guess nothing is perfect but this movie  together with schindlers list  is your best even oprah acts well in this one what got me most is the realism of the story and drama stuff like this happened and is still happening in the world
301,i would like to comment on the movie april love its one of my all time favorites because my father nelson malone plays the horse trainer i remember distinctly when hollywood came to lexington ky where we were living at the time to make april love my dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man i talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered and lo and behold he came home wthe script how exciting is that also a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes  especially the ones shown at the amusement park its very nostalgic every april when i see the movie being shown once again and the song april love by pat boone is still played on the radio timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today wall the sex foul language and violence it would be refreshing to see more movies like april love come back into focus
302,just after the end of wwii powell  pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the uk  the usa at the time there was a lot of overpaid over sexed and over here type of comments somehow they came up with this masterpiecemy favourite movie of all time its got everything romance poetry emotion religion drama and very quirkyi can never explain exactly why but it hits all the right buttons and although ive seen it hundreds of times yes really im still guaranteed to be in tears at many points throughoutwas it the magnificent acting the wonderful sets the inspired script  who knows but do watch it and youll see what i mean
303,the pilot of enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original star trek a dose of realistic flawed personalities the utopian characters of the next generation got tiring they were so noble as to be unbelievable i also like the subplot that humans are bitter toward the vulcans its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs it makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two though i dont think it would work in the time frame of the show the only negatives that jumped out at me were the quick cut off the ending at 2 hours feel of the end which is common among many of the trek shows the second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes it was out of place a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the preteen audience with some skin but its not my job to make the show profitable so oh welllets see how the next episode does
304,this is one of the most overlooked gems hollywood has ever produced  a young wwii british fighter ace whose plane is about to crash has radio contact with a young american woman who comforts the brave pilot knowing that within minutes he will be dead for some reason the man who should certainly be dead walks away from the wreckage and eventually learns that he was meant to report to heaven when a messanger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven the man refuses and demands to have his day in court to argue his case the man argues that his situation had changed during the final moments of his earthly life that he had fallen in love and therefor had become a different person one who deserved a chance to live on the heavenly court is a cinematic delight the announcement of the jury of peers is a definite highlight the story as fantastic as it seems is an engaging one and will keep you spellbound for the nearly 2 hours play time the final scene is simply beautiful and will require a kleenex treatment for most viewers this film is in my personal alltime favorite top 10 it has my highest recommendation
305,it has been about 50 years since a movie has been made about romance and mysticism the only two movies i can think of is enchanted april 1992 and the enchanted cottage 1945 both movies used wonderful actors not stars in both movies all the actors gave their best romantic performancesenchanted april is about four english women after wwi who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in italy while on vacation it is amazing enchanted april was made in 1992 it stands out as an enjoyable classic
306,i anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly cliché but i was completely wrong charlie cox i had never heard of him until now played an incredibly good leading man he was so earnest and romantic me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with himclaire danes who i did like before loved her in romeo and juliet made me enjoy her even more her acting was fantastic i couldnt even tell that she was american the chemistry between her and charlie cox was extremely good the casting was quite perfectrobert deniro and michelle pfeiffer were equally wellcasted deniro as that gay piratepriceless priceless i laughed so hard at that one scene where septimus comes on the shipoh my god wow pfeiffer played a decent villain i liked her as the snippy mother in hairspray but she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie overall it was funny but not slapstick at all romantic the special effects werent totally frequent but when they were they were great the cameos from ricky gervais and peter otoole were also wellplaced i totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the princess bride or even lord of the rings it kept my interest the entire time and i will be buying the dvd when it comes out
307,im sure that not many people outside of australia have ever heard of the legend of ned kelly i once saw a documentary about the man but thats the only time i once saw or heard anything about him and i guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face noone knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subjectthe movie tells the story of ned kellys life the irish immigrant has lived in northwest victoria all his life but has never been very welcome by the authorities the police always accuses him of everything they can think of and they keep harassing his family when kelly is fed up with the way everything goes he forms a gang with his brother and two other men they start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days all this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen they are outlawed finally they take over a pub in glenrowan where they have a party with all the visitors waiting for a train full of police to derail at a part of the track that they tore up but the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four gunmenits very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false i guess nobody really knows because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth one camp says he was a hero some kind of robin hood the others will say he was an ordinary criminal a murderer and a thief i really couldnt tell you which of them is right perhaps both are but what i can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the samethis movie was a nice addition to the documentary i once saw and i really enjoyed the performances of all the actors heath ledger orlando bloom naomi watts geoffrey rush are all actors who are pretty well known but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like i really enjoyed this movie and i give it a 7510

311,peter weirs first international success the last wave is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on aboriginal myth richard chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving aboriginal tribal rivalries david gulpilil plays one of the suspects who does his best to guide chamberlin thru the realm of dreamtime an alternate realitytimeline central to native australian history and tribal custom heavy on atmosphere deliberately ambiguous in plotting the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects probably due to budgetary limitations nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as reality will stay with you
312,to me a matter of life and death is just that simply the best film ever madefrom beginning to end it oozes class it is stimulating thought provoking a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoplesthe cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly the characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasyno matter how many times i watch the film  and i have watched it a lot  it never fails to touch me it makes me smile it makes me laugh it makes me think it makes me cry it is as fresh today as it was in 1946if i were allowed just one film to keep and watch again a matter of life and death would be that film
313,this is the best film version of dickens classic tale ive seen it over and over on vhs and recently acquired the dvd version which is formatted for tv not widescreen what i find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of english actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other filmsshows in north america since 1984 my biggest surprise is edward woodward the equalizer as the ghost of christmas present
314,this was an exteremely good historical drama john turturro is excellent as the tortured genius luzhin and brilliantly portrays the characters manic affectations such as his strange dancing emily watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover nataliathe relatonship between chess and near madness is well explored by gorris and familiar nabokov preoccupations such as eternal innocence ie lolita are evident in this film i think i will now go on to read the novel it was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye brilliant movie
315,also known as the big spook war the great yokai war is miikes attempt at a family film and damn fine job he does as well the problem is that i cant imagine many parents wanting to subject their children to this movie the best kids movies are the ones that are scary or have mildly disturbing imagery neverending story and return to oz spring to mind but in the case of the great yokai war miike probably takes things a little too far in fact at the screening i was at the person introducing the movie reiterated to the two families there that it was probably not very suitablethe film kicks off with the young hero of the piece introducing himself and explaining about his current family problems this brief moment of mundanity is sharply broken as a cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a human whom screams that something horrendous is coming before falling dead like the abomination it is it is quite possible that the sheer hideousness of the creature is some bizarre quato homagefollowing an incredible introduction for main baddie kato and his henchwoman agi a surprisingly attractive chiaki kuriyami by way of an apocalyptic army raising the story reverts to normal for a while but it doesnt take long before any and all logic goes down the drain and the young boy teams up with a group of miyazaki rejects to take out the evil sorcererthe plot of the movie is fairly basic and surprisingly hackneyed at times the entire chosen one just seems completely out of place in a movie which so regularly breaks clichés but is aided by a simple awe inspiring vision of a magical world this really is a miyazaki movie made into a live action movie albeit a much seedier and more vicious than usual miyazaki moviethe film is simply a joy to look at the designs of the yokai is colourful and largely practical while the evil robotic monstrosities while not displaying the best cgi in the world have a practicality and menace to them which gives them far more of a palpable threat than you would imaginethe cast is uniformly excellent they just make their characters seem perfectly natural which is commendable when you consider that most of them are in full body makeup or latex suits even agi lumbered with a ridiculous beehive comes across as sultry and deadly thanks to surprisingly excellent acting from kuriyamiwhile the film does have many elements which put it firmly into family movie territory cute creatures junior heroes a thoroughly evil villain a sense of mischief and adventure and a telling lack of violence there are elements which make you question whether miike should have directed such a moviethe robot army is a genuinely terrifying menace everyday items warped into monstrous beasts that look like t101 sans skin and with added chainsaws these beasts rip characters to pieces suck creatures into their blood stained mouths and abduct children from their homes by swiping them right from under their parents nose before indulging in a little patricidethe creation of the creature is equally arduous for young minds the yokai essentially the heroes are feed into a giant furnace full of a liquidised form of hate which corrodes the yokais flesh and forces their angry souls to possess lumps of metal if kids thought smouldering anakin was bad wait til they see a man sized hedgehog burning to death in a vat of molten hatred for a minute before being turned into an abomination of a motorcycle there is also limb severing in one case a severed hand twitches in front of the camera dripping with blood a fair amount of sexual energy agi wears one dress designed specifically for fan service and seems to only have sleeping with kato as motivation while the princess of the rivers wears next to nothing and gets her thighs groped by the young hero in several scenes and general humour which will go right over the heads of those that this technicolour wonder was seemingly designed forspoilers an example of this being that the yokai only become interested in the final battle when they think it is a big party the subsequent battle more of a festival than anything complete with beer crowd surfing and moshing also a scene where agi beats the tar out of a cute furry creature seems designed to appeal to the masses jaded by pokemon overkillend spoilers at the end of the day the great yokai war is easily on of miikes stronger recent films while it lacks some of the perverse charm of say gozu or ichi it is just continually pushing the audience down a road of general insanity in fact this is easily miikes most deranged movie in that he embraces the sheer magic of the subject so wholeheartedlywell worth a watch just for the occasional flash of gogo arse
316,there is star trek canon  lots of it from canon we know the history of the future advances in technology events places first contacts with new beings names dates etcenterprise pretty much disregards much of st canon an unfortunate fact for long time serious fans as one i assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of tos and retro back from there  but nothe phase pistols like much of the technology look much more modern than found in tos an old style starfleet laser gun a slow gold speckle transporter effect  thats what i expected to see also i did not expect to hear pure beepbased sound effects similar to tng but far apart from tos sound effects in the earliest view of tos the original pilot the cage we see a starfleet with a more formal military aspect  a bit of old earth navy with enterprise we see a shocking disregard for rank there is more military code in the cartoon star blazers than in enterpriseit is fine that captain archer is unsure about the needs of the universe quite unlike kirk who never lacked confidence in his application of human justice but inside enterprise everyone seems like an equal unprofessional unsure more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any st series  and that says a lotthe casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vesselenterprise looks to show us a mostly fun warmfuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic bold gritty highrick exploration of spacei would have selected adrian paul to play the captain and an older human to be the doctor still i liked the actors for the most part linda park an outstanding ballroom dancer from boston college is sure to develop nicely the characters making up the crew seem to be thoughtfully createdenterprise begins its run stronger than did the past three star trek series lets hope for a good future
317,la maman et la putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released post68 and eternal in many respects true the actors dont act  true they talk a lot but what they talk about is just what makes life worth living or dying the very long monologue spoken by françoise lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood manhood and love not easy to translate accurately though this movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman or two women in this case and imho jean pierre léaud is one of the greatest french actors
318,the first von trier movie ive ever seen was breaking the waves sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa europa tells a story of a young germanamerican who wants to experience germany just after the second world war he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train because of his job he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany meeting with the killing of traitors and hunt for former nazi party members the society is suffering from corruption his uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called werewolves they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains the atmosphere is astounding the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene just when you think youve seen a lot europe
319,the literary genius of vladimir navokov is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice the director puts us in check mate with the story of alexander an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted she meets alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket a magnetic attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day the mother alarmed telegrams the husband he arrives and questioning alexander we get these fades to the past ala godfather ii where we see young alexander a child prodigy he is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums thinking alexander reached his peak abandons him but becomes legend the old teacher returns causing harm trying to give victory to an old rival of alexander in a serious chess game where world chess champion victory is one way to immortality the chess clock ticks match time ends to conclude the next day that day is nastasyas wedding the old teacher interferes and alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown nastasya holding her stomach and looking thru her loves coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves though the film unfortunately sways from its russian roots its low back cut dresses are lovely alexander plays his role sublimelythe director underestimated her audience we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of the luzhin defense is after trading queens isolate the opponents king with your 3 paws  king sacrificing the castle for mate nastasya is a great match but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her the luzhin defense elegantly gives navokov honor the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed
320,the first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least however it improved afterwards as the valentine party commenced apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie the scene at the garden with kate was well shot and so was the very last scene the twist in those scenes there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty the way slashers should be edge to it the earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore
321,this is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion its thought provoking funny and sad with amazing performances all around all the characters are wonderful and the story is just brilliant plus jodie foster and cherie currie are simply amazing in this the ending is very powerful however i wont spoil it for you and i thought the character development was top notch plus you can really relate to all of the characters especially jeanie and annie as you will be rooting for them plus i loved how it moved slowly and giving you a chance to get to know all the characters and what there about i cant believe this only has a 59 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion and it was funny seeing randy quaid in this type of role plus this is extremely well written and made as well one scene that really got to me was when madgemarilyn kagan is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party and the film has many surprising moments as well plus the dialog is especially excellent this is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion its thought provoking funny and sad with amazing performances all around and i say go see it immediately your bound to love it the direction is fantastic adrian lyne does a fantastic job here with awesome camera work and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace the acting is amazing jodie foster is really cute and is amazing as always she was extremely likable caring had a lovable character was intense in some scenes was focused and she and cherie currie were the heart of the film as jeanie and anniefoster rules cherie currie is way hot and is amazing here i really felt sorry for her character as she had a very likable character that just needed help she gives a powerful performance and created a very memorable character she was amazing scott baio is great as brad he was really likable and did his job well i liked him randy quaid is great in his serious role surprisingly i liked him sally kellerman is great as the mother i liked her a lot marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are both very good as madge and deirdre and did what they had to do well as the other two friends laura dern has a very early role here as it was cool to see her not much of a part though rest of the cast do fine overall go see it immediately its an underrated masterpiece  out of 5
322,this is what i call a growth movie every character is different and better at the end and its all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a tub of love josie lawrence who is best known as a comedienne really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes even the men in this film go from being selfcentered to better men the book stayed very true to the novel which is a plus in my book since i am a librarian the scenery breathtaking and the message of love genuine
323,an ultranervous old man mr goodrich terrorized by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing really panics when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it saying you will be next he calls the detective agency wondering where are the guys he asked for earlier of course its the stooges who couldnt respond because had come into the office robbed them and tied them up some detectives the moment poor mr goodrich hangs up the phone and says i feel safer already a monstertype goon named nico appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious we next find out that his trusted employees are anything but that now these crooks have to deal with the detectives that are coming by the house for mr goodrichsome of the gags like moe and larrys wrinkles are getting a bit old but some of them will provoke laughs if i see them 100 times i always laugh at shemp trying to be a flirt as he does here with mr goodrichs niece in a classic routine with a long accordionlike camera lens the act he puts on when hes poisoned is always funny too shemp was so good that i didnt mind he was taking the great curlys placelarry moe curlyshemp were always great in the chase scenes in which monsters or crooks or both are chasing them around a house thats the last six minutes in here at times such as this film

325,sandwiched in between san francisco and captains courageous two of spencer tracys greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people they gave him a gun stars spencer tracy and franchot tone in the only film they ever made together and gladys george as the woman who loves them bothtracy and tone are a couple of world war i draftees tone is a weak character who almost goes over the hill in boot camp but tracy stops him tracy is still playing the lovable blowhard younger wallace beery type that mgm envisioned for him when they signed him away from fox over at the front tone gets an opportunity and takes it when during a fight he manages to get to a church tower that peers down on a german machine gun nest hes learned to shoot by now and he does a sergeant york but alvin c york was never changed by the war the way tone haswounded in the fight tone convalesces at a hospital with gladys george looking out for him tracy goes awol himself to visit his pal and he and george get something going later on when tracy is reported missing in action tone and george marry tracys brokenhearted when he comes back and learns of the marriage but takes sit in stride the rest of the film is dealing with tone applying the the wartime skills hes learned to the gangster trade hes a hitman now and george doesnt really know what he does for a living i think you can figure the rest outthe part of the film that gave me some trouble is that i cant believe gladys george couldnt figure it out shes a street smart girl her part is very much like the one she played in the roaring twenties opposite james cagneyspeaking of the roaring twenties humphrey bogarts character development there is similar to tones although he was not the central character of the movie in fact there are elements of they gave him a gun that are to be found in taxi driver and in clint eastwoods classic the unforgiven the world war i battle sequences are very well staged by director woody van dyke for some reason leonard maltin panned this film i think its a lot better than he gave it credit
326,vivah is by no means a classic however in the days of hardcore action pathbreaking special effects  complex plots none of which bollywood has mastered yet its quite refreshing to see a simple film like vivah the story as we all know is a journey from a couples first meeting to their eventual wedding after some coy moments and testing times nothing more nothing less the music isnt quite in the same league as mpk or hahk but doesnt jar your senses either two songs stood out for me  mujhe haq hai  do anjaane while milan abhi aadha  hamaari shaadi were hummable shahid performs sincerely  shows a lot of potential its good to see him play something else but the cool dude he normally does amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile smalltown girl to perfection alok nath anupam kher  seema biswas are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job surajs direction is simple but effective the movies prime flaw is the slow pace which might test the patience of a lot of young viewers but all in all a good clean decent family movie
327,the legend of zu as i saw it was a very interesting story i think many of the people who didnt like it were not seeing the underlying mythology behind the film they were expecting something akin to star wars and it was not that joseph campbell i believe would have liked this film there were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked we all have a mountain of swords within us we all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives we all have to face our own insomnia someday granted some of the narration was a bit confusing and some of the action got a little hokey at times but i think other points of the film easily made up for it id watch it again i dont know if theres a difference between the legend of zu which i saw in mandarin with english subtitles and zu warriors the dubbed usa version it might have been dumbed down for american audiences which really would have detracted from this film
328,this film is a jolt of punk rock fun from start to finish the ramones reigning princes of late70s punk rock appear as themselves pj soles stars as riff randle the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock n roll riff is obsessed with writing songs for the ramones her favorite rock band she keeps the school rockin and encourages her fellowstudents to join her in her jubilant anticsmeanwhile the school that riff attends has just hired a brandnew principal named ms togar shes a tall intimidating amazon of a woman and she vows to make the students toetheline she even has a couple of the students act as monitors who report back to her with dirt on their classmates ms togar is especially determined to nab riff and put a stop to riffs anarchic shenanigans but riff has clever ways to foil togar at every turnkudos to the superb performance of mary woronov in her role as principal togar mary is a legendary b movie actress and in this film she plays the fascist ms togar with sneering relish pj soles as riff turns in an electrifying performance clint howard as the duplicitous eaglebauer has lots of fun with his rolethe ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film and so the viewer sees why the ramones were so influential in the 70s punk rock scene certainly this is a good film for ramones fans but even if youre not into the ramones or punk rock this movie is a terrific blast literally of energetic fun
329,after star wars a new hope redefined science fiction and the empire strikes back redefined star wars its hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two but this one really does a nice job the first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and whats going on in the war there is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellions final confrontation with the emperor when the battle begins the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films this climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy with the most at stake for the rebellion this is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land including han solo chewbacca and leia the battle raging on in space including lando and a confrontation between luke and the emperor on the new death star which leads up to another duel with darth vader it is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war and there seems to be no escape although i think the idea of ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit farfetched it didnt seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers although they did have some luck fighting them there is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming which may not be quite as stunning as that of the empire strikes back but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well with the light tone of a new hope and the more sinnister tone of the empire strikes back this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale the special edition for return of the jedi concentrated on what would have been nice to change since not much of the original really needed it fifteen years of technology advancements didnt seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned and there still is the occasional disappearing tie fighter but other than that it was good the gaping nonthreatening sarlaacs mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge flytrap looking head that emerged which definitely added to the suspense also the disco was taken out of jabbas palace and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy instead of just a small ewok village which was the case of the original and that didnt really end a story this big the way it deserved its hard to say which of the three films was the best but since its all part of the same story the overall trilogy is like one big outstanding film a third mustsee for film fans
330,this is essentially a variation on house of wax in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies vincent pricein both pictures he plays a talented artist who is sent toppling over the edge into insanity when his creations are usurped by otherless talented and less scrupulous people in this movie he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist the great rinaldo john emeryinsists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any illusions he designsprice is already ill disposed towards rinaldi as his former wife is now a paramour of rinaldi he deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon rinaldi and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designerprice is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well judged star turn as a wronged man whose predicament earns audience sympathythe rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on price who carries the burden with ease good solid b movie melodrama  this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you dont expect a masterpiece shot in black and white it is low on gore and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance
331,as much as the movie was good i have nothing more to say about it than what was said already all i wanted is to point the fact that the movie isnt from sweden but from denemark maybe i wrong and in that case ill be happy to know my mistakes so take the and notify me
332,i hate overlong overtalky french movies but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest french movie of them all i saw it twice in the mid70s and then it disappeared but i finally got to see it again in 1999 and fell in love all over again what is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it did 25 years ago if you havent seen it dont miss your chance
333,foxes is a great film the four young actresses jodie foster cherie currie marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are wonderful the song on the radio by donna summer is lovely a great film 
334,this film is fantastic finally wellwritten characters you can love for all their good and bad pierce brosnan is flatout hysterical in this selfeffacing role i think its the best thing hes ever done hes done other roles that exhibited shades of being capable of this kind of fullyfledged work but this role finally gave him the room to run with it i almost died when he walked across the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots and greg kinnear and hope davis are a couple to aspire too as well as actors to aspire too kinnear is so goofy likable that his turn in the end is truly gratifying you give good actors good work to play with and they give us something more back
335,this movie was just as good as some of the other westerns made by anthony mann and james stewart like winchester 73 and the naked spur and much better than thunder bay and bend of the river this film starts out like a run of the mill western but gets more complex as it goes along it starts out with jimmy stewart and walter brennan arriving in seattle and stewart is charged with murder he is found innocent but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge stewart then agrees to lead something but i forget what it is but stewart only cares about getting his cattle back as the movie goes along its like stewart only cares about himself just like his character in the naked spur it gets much better at the halfway point after they arrive in alaska this is one of stewarts better westerns
336,to anyone who might think this show isnt for them please give it a try network television has degenerated into shows that are clones of clones or are reality based shows featuring some often unreal people this show is a return to family oriented tv where the emphasis is on learning some life lessons learning what real friends and family are about and maybe even learning a little bit about our national pastime jeremy sumpter is one of the most appealing young actors in show business today and he is perfectly cast as the young slightly naive new batboy for the fictional new york empires great name dean cain christopher lloyd mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the main cast and they are all exceptional this show deserves a chance to catch on and be seen hopefully it will stick around for a few seasons and we can watch pete young sumpters character learn and grow
337,bromwell high is nothing short of brilliant expertly scripted and perfectly delivered this searing parody of a students and teachers at a south london public school leaves you literally rolling with laughter its vulgar provocative witty and sharp the characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of british society or to be more accurate of any society following the escapades of keisha latrina and natella our three protagonists for want of a better term the show doesnt shy away from parodying every imaginable subject political correctness flies out the window in every episode if you enjoy shows that arent afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable then bromwell high will not disappoint
338,a series of random seemingly insignificant thefts at her sisters boarding house has miss lemon quite agitated a ring light bulbs a rucksack a lighter a stethoscope a shoe  there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it miss lemon asks her employer the great belgian detective hercule poirot to look into the matter but what poirot sees is something far more sinister than miss lemon could have imagined and poirots fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered its up to poirot to bring a killer to justicehickory dickory dock is a solid but not spectacular entry in the long running poirot series i appreciate how faithful the script is to agatha christies original story i realize that certain liberties had to be taken but i appreciate the effort nonetheless the major points of the mystery are all there  the petty thefts the boarding house the students the ripped rucksack and of course poirots ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens with a few exceptions the cast of students is almost as i pictured them damian lewis and jessica lloyd standout among the group as mush as i always enjoy david suchets poirot i get a real kick out of the episodes with phillip jacksons inspector japp and pauline morans miss lemon this episode is a real treat as miss lemon gets more screen time than usual finally i enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel its a fun little play on the hickory dickory dock titlei realized while rewatching hickory dickory dock just what a tremendous influence agatha christies work was on the highly stylized italian mystery films or gialli of the 60s and 70s take the murder of mrs nicoletis as an example if you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene you would have something straight out of an early 70s giallo in fact the entire plot of hickory dickory dock could have been used in a giallo its just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked
339,and heres yet another piece of evidence to claim that we should all worship the italian giallo and acknowledge it to be the absolute most unique sub genre in horror emilio miraglias the red queen kills seven times is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting stylish production values enchanting music great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences its a fabulous giallo released in the golden year 1972 that belongs in the topfive of every fan of italian cinema the storyline doesnt just introduce your average blackgloved  sexually frustrated killer but blends good oldfashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth of the murderous red queen at young age their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings kitty and evelyn about an uncanny lady who once every 100 years on april 6th kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim fourteen years later kitty has become the successful choreographer of a prominent modeling agency even sharing her bed with the general manager when suddenly the killing spree begins sister evelyn would be the obvious culprit but she moved to the states recently or has she complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown at you every couple of minutes and the red queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallohistory her face can never be seen but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim shes not exactly gentle either as her victims are barbarically stabbed with a dagger dragged behind cars and even impaled on fences that latter one is truly one of the greatest  most gruesome acts of violence ive ever seen what more could you possibly request some classy and tasteful nudity perhaps the gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered among them barbara bouchet and a young sybil danning emilio miraglia isnt the most famous giallodirector as he only made this one and the equally recommended the night evelyn came out of the grave but his influence and importance should not be forgotten
340,it is no surprise that writerdirector michael powell considered a matter of life and death his and emeric pressburgers spellbinding fantasy from 1946 to be his favourite of their films together released during the aftermath of world war 2 this colourful romantic adventure would have provided just the tonic for a traumatised recovering nation in need of a good upliftfollowing a string of other patriotic war films the archers made this one their quirkiest skittish and most patriotic of the lot quintessentially british for upholding british heritage shakespeare beer fair play good manners it is also visibly americanised in its baroque compositions technical inventiveness and a fine multiethnic castoddly echoing another 1946 classic its a wonderful life amolad opens on a grand firmament with one of those jolly voiceovers preaching about the earth and the heavens and what a big wonderful world we live in it then cuts to the inside of a british cockpit badly hit up in flames and with the copilot already dead it sounds misconceived but the connection is soon made lucid with the events that followclocking in at nearly 5 minutes the rapidfire exchange between british pilot peter david niven and american radio contact june kim hunter is breathtaking in its intimacy resigned to dying peter nevertheless exhausts plenty of vigour charm and outpouring confessions and his warm affiliation with june closes with a mutual exchange of i love you keeping with the magic of the moment peter by oversight of his conductor 71 whose job it was to transport him to the other world escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach he later encounters june riding a bicycle and instantly matches the body with the voice but realising their error the high court want peter sent back and order the french conductor maurice goring down to earth to retrieve him but peter is adamant to live because of june and the conductors mistake and wilfully guards his cornerpeters fate ultimately lies with the heavenly court and american prosecutor raymond massey whose jury consists of several deceased war heroes and posh british delegates the surreal trial which dissolves from bw back into rich technicolor once the verdict is announced may well be a dream but the final shot in the hospital validates the predictable outcomethe abstract frame filling stairway to heaven the american title of the film is used twice the first time in bw when it elevates peter and his enigmatic french guardian upwards crossing giant statues of peters potential attorneys for the trial including abraham lincoln and plato the second time the softly lit colour stairway provides the setting for what is an iconic image in cinema  peter and june frozen sidebyside their marvelled eyes fixed forward in the frame their fate sealedthe unlikely affection shared between peter and june never turns mushy or verbose its treated with nobility and the perception that the couple are already suitable enough to be married and simply need to convince people of their love so it can keep them together the french conductor who can freeze time and peoples bodies obtrudes many of their key moments together lecturing peter about history and among his mischievous tricks pinching peters top 100 game tricks book and his coffee cupas visually inspired as other powellpressburger collaborations this was the first time they combined colour with bw  the latter having a cheerful quality when used for the heaven scenes and both are equally captivating the outstanding script more than matches the imaginative set design with dialogue that sounds so immediate that is doesnt feel like it was written or performed for the screen amusing and witty powellpressburgers writing deserves equal acclamation with their forte for colour and compositionmade in 1946 a matter of life and death is one of those films that defies it age looking fresh and inventive even in this age where cgi would vamp up its artificial effects probably stripping them of their emotional wonder other jarring changes would include the need for reduced average seconds for cutting and the inevitable plea to shorten dialogue so it can preserve the low attention spans of most audiences powell weaves a spell that subconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame giving him freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of peters predicament
341,dark comedy gallows humor how does one make a comedy out of murder it can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people so the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work so pierce brosnan the irishmans answer to 007 is now cast as a chainsmoking sexaddicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis he meets a struggling businessman greg kinnear and after a rocky beginning he learns that he needs a friend but gregs happily married to hope davis and brosnan sees in him the basic things he doesnt have love home and a life add character actor philip baker hall as the hitmans manager and were off to the races brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the antihero and kinnear delightful as his counterpart the very human businessman hope davis adds a sparkle as kinnears very conventional wife who is fascinated with this derelict who drifts into their lives the ending is delightful and with some surprise to it you should leave the theater feeling at least partly good if youre able to suspend being aghast at killing people

343,a stunning realization occurs when some sort of phenomenon takes place be it firecrackers going off witnessing a robbery a hurricane nonchalantly devastating everything in its path or for that matter any other spectacular occurrence  in the case of the maclean family however reveille was something which was no more complex than their day to day livesmontana in the early twentieth century was an environment which was rough and tumblethe maclean family was comprised of four people the father a minister who was ideologically driven to raise his family properly his wife was god fearing and dutiful the two boys were wellboys what else can you saybrad pitt starred in this film before he was really the brad pitt and his acting performance in this film was to say the least remarkable his brother norman was the cerebral type he was touched by emotions that were genuine and motivated by a set of values that missoula montana concurred with paul brad pitt was a misfit from the offset and lived on the edgeyou would think that montana in the 1920s had no such thing yet somehow gambling drinking and violent confrontations were as much a part of paul as was his fly fishing rod fly fishing did i say that parenthetically this was the core of this movies theme the recreation of fly fishing served as the cohesive bond which homogenized the kindred spirits of the maclean brothers and to a lesser degree the father i would describe the acting in this film as incredibly believable and the cinematography went beyond sensational put it this way anyone who sees this film will want to live in montana breathtaking filmography of bluer than blue mountains and streams captured the youth and effervescence that the maclean brothers had for lifeseldom in a film do you witness whereby feelings immediately invoke a dogged tenacity to accomplish whatever it may be that someone wishes to accomplishthe maclean brothers lived life to the fullest and for better or worse the father knew that this was going to be the only way the two of them could become menrobert redford directs this film and tells the story of the macleans through the perspective of the older brother normannorman gets offered a position at the university of chicago at age 26 and marries the woman he will always be in love withwhat this film also points out is that the younger brother paul has attained an accomplishment of his own by being the epitome of a remarkable fly fisherman the seedier side of life prevails in the younger brothers existence and exerts an insidious form of consternation for the maclean family as most human shortcomings go the maclean family made light of turbulent waters literally and thus established unity as a family by putting necessary blinders onthe end of the movie river runs through it presents an epigram of life through the eyes of the older brother for norman maclean stoicism is a prerequisite to perseverance in his emeritus years such a fate is largely due to the fact that reflecting on his life is tantamount to yearning for people who have passed away the fond memories of his brother his wife his mother and his father must now be viewed philosophically for norman his life has been relegated to stubborn facts that have determined his dubious outlook and precarious resolve something as simple as the statement this was your life and that is how you lived it is a somber recollection of the joy the sorrow the regrets and the love he gave as well as was the recipient of best put in the last sermon he heard his father give his father said we can completely love someone without completely understanding them whether you agree with what has happened in your life or not it happened nonetheless norman maclean must come to grips with the fact that his life has been fragmented by misunderstandings norman maclean has become a decrepit octogenarian who is polarized by virtual conclusions to his life the murky waters of montanas picturesque rivers serve as a vicious and desultory finalization to his years on earth without question the very prolific statement of what seems complicated is really very simple purveys a very acrimonious message in this moviemore simply putthe people and places which were important in normans life are now only a bittersweet memorymerely a painfully intellectual rumination of events which are aggravated by the haunted waters of montanas beautiful streams and riversto which for the entire maclean family all things merge into one and a river runs through it

347,bogdonovichs mostly unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other a film that has the feel of a fairy tale but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic manhattan locations and true geography perhaps the best location filming in nyc ive ever seen john ritter reminds us that with good directors bogdanovich blake edwards billy bob he can be brilliant and the entire ensemble is a group youll wish truly existed so you could spend time with em one of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesnt seem to be a ripoff of something else this is the high point of bogdanovichs fertile after success career when his best work was truly done saint jack at long last noises off
348,this movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny if you think of seeing this one for the shootings stay clear this one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure even the detectives are seeking the answer we all dowhy fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with yes the language is harsh at times but it suits the characters well there are some loose ends left or unanswered but all movies have these the major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents highly recommended for teens and adults

352,this is mostly a story about the growing relationship between jeff websterjimmy stewart and ronda castleruth roman she takes an instant liking to jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to skagway and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder they find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction neither trusts a member of the opposite sex apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them gradually they learn to trust each other as they journey from skagway to dawson but ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff gannon and engages in some shady practices in her castle saloon in skagway she eventually has to decide between gannon and jeff meanwhile rene a young naive french woman also takes an immediate liking to jeff but only gets insulting brush offs in return yet she sticks with him in his travels from skagway to dawson and his activities around dawson along with ronda she nurses him back to health after jeff is left for dead by gannons gunslingers at his gold claim walter brennan as ben serves as jeffs long time sidekick he doesnt have a meaty role but serves to soften jeffs hard edges his demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for jeffjohn mcintireas sheriff gannon makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying evidently he sees something of himself in jeff repeatedly declaring that hes going to like him he makes a believable incarnation of the infamous soapy smith who spent his last years in skagway as one of the premier con men of his timesjeff is the quintessential antihero a lonerexcept for companion ben who doesnt want to stick his neck out for others even when he knows he is the one right man for the job in this respect he closely resembles burt lancasters character in vera cruz for example thus jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of dawson he is convinced to leave dawson after gannons gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyones insufficiently legal gold claims while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from dawson even ronda suggests that she and jeff make a hurried exit from dawson while they are still alive then jeff has a sudden change of heart apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of ben and himself he changes from antihero to hero in leading the expulsion of gannons gang from dawson in this respect he differs from lancasters character who never reformsbut is jeff truly changed or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own intereststhe main problem i see with the plot is the 2 principle women clearly ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame jeff although she is clearly characterized as a bad girl jeff has a checkered recent past himself having shot at least 5 men in the us or yukon and having stolen his cattle back from gannon ironically soon after jeff changes from antihero to hero rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn jeff of gannons impending ambush she dies as a result and jeff asks her why she didnt just look out for herselfhis supposedly just abandoned creedits clear that corine calvert as renee just doesnt make a credible substitute for the dead ronda in jeffs mind yet the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together even though jeff never visibly gives her a kiss or hug her image as a good if naive young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in rhondas saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later im also very unclear about her relationship with rube morris a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with herhes not her fatheranother problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between jeff and gannons gang if gannon had any skill at all with a pistol he should have killed or seriously wounded jeff under that boardwalk before jeff did the same to him and how did jeffs badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease i also wonder what jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims they were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow and why werent most of rondas pack horses and mules also buried by the avalancheyou will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and gannons gang the sequences shot in the canadian rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action allinall a very entertaining western with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end no doubt this film takes some great liberties with history and geography especially the part taking place in the canadian yukon which was in fact much tamer than the us skagway

356,this movie stars emily watson of breaking the waves fame this movie about one mans obsession takes place at a resort where a chess tournament is being held a chess master arrives and shortly after falls madly in love at first sight with a woman played by emily watson she falls for this oddball of a man who is obsessed with chess this is all at the dismay of her mother who is far more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman a proper gentleman her mother feels that this is just a passing fancy for the young woman as she has a tendency to take in odd animals and such what ensues is mostly a journey through the mans psyche it tells the story of how his past is closely tied with his present emily watson is amazing in this as well as the actor who plays the main character it is definitely slow but is well worth the watching the ending was even satisfying 
357,wisecracker the biography of actor william haines offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies the old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a los angeles museum screening of show people the late silent feature in which he costarred with marion davies beforehand haines was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter but he was pleasantly surprised and no doubt relieved at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it watch the film today and you can see why show people is a delightful hollywood satire that retains its charm because it lampoons its targets with wit and flair yet without malice its still funny and its satirical points still resonate needless to say the technology of moviemaking has changed vastly since the silent days but the pretensions and follies of the filmmakers themselves havent changed all that muchshow people also stands as the best surviving work of marion davies a firstrate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes where her career was concerned davies was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of her paramour the newspaper magnate william randolph hearst its well known that hearst exerted enormous influence over davies choice of roles and well known too that despite her gift for comedy he preferred to see her play dignified heroines in period costume dramas by the late 20s for whatever reason marion was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies including the red mill and the patsy but show people directed by the great king vidor stands as her most enjoyable showcase william haines gives an engaging likable performance as her boyfriend and costar billy boone but this is the leading ladys show all the waymarion plays southern belle peggy pepper an aspiring actress who storms hollywood accompanied by her father determined to become a movie star her dad colonel pepper is played by actordirector dell henderson a veteran of griffiths biograph dramas whocoincidentallyresembled hearst one of marions funniest bits often excerpted elsewhere is her audition at the comet studio casting office while dad helpfully suggests emotions to portray sorrow    joy and drops a handkerchief across her face peggy assumes the appropriate expression and posture shes hired only to discover that comet makes lowbrow comedies the kind of comedies where people squirt each other with seltzer and inept cops tumble over each other racing to the rescue of course comet is intended as a takeoff of mack sennetts keystone but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds as peggy pepper rises in the movie star hierarchy she leaves comet for the more prestigious high art studio assuming the name patricia peppoire as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress at some point it may occur to us as it surely did to viewers in 1928 that davies rival gloria swanson started out in keystone comedies before rising to prominence in serious dramas for cecil b demille and as miss peppoire takes herself more and more seriously giving the highhat treatment to former colleagues such as lowly comic billy boone davies performance takes on an element of wicked parody seemingly aimed squarely at swanson herself this is especially notable during an interview sequence when miss peppoires spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spoton impersonation of swanson i suppose this was intended as a friendly spoof but i have to wonder how friendly relations were between gloria and marion after this movie was releasedin any event show people is a delicious treat for buffs who will relish the parade of star cameos throughout charlie chaplin contributes a nice bit sans makeup and looking quite distinguished eagerly seeking patricia peppoires autograph and in a show of good sportsmanship marion davies herself puts in a selfmocking cameo appearance evening the score for poking fun at swanson by poking fun at herself this is a silent film that viewers not especially attuned to silents might appreciate at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business show people surely belongs in the company of such classics as sunset boulevard and singin in the rain among hollywoods most expertly produced enjoyable exercises in amused selfexamination
358,i couldnt believe the comments made about the movieas i read the awful opinions about the movie i actually wondered if you had actually viewed the same movie that i didwhat i viewed was incredible i think the actresses and director did a fantastic job in the moviei hadnt had the pleasure to see either actress previously and i couldnt have been more set back by the incredible job that they did id have to say its the most believable movie that ive seen in a long time what i dont see is why everyone has such a problem with deannas choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice that i dont understand its a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else so how it can be the actresses error i fail to see i think it was a real believable movie that i would see again and recommend opinions are what the are and its too bad that so many are so close minded i hope to see any of the actors soon i think that all played great rolesbusy philipps will be the highest paid actress someday and i hope she can laugh in the face of everyone that criticized her you go girl
359,what is very french about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters this might require a bit of patience especially since neither is attractive in the typical hollywood definition of such however once the heist kicks in the film rushes forward quickly perhaps at times too quickly but it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you dont look too closely it is all quite believable the kind of film that you know hollywood would have botched up
360,i just wanna say that amongst all the socalled classic hiphop films ive seen like wild style krushgroove breakin style wars etc imo beat street is the best amongst the others whenever i ask other people about which is their fave then it seems that beat street pops out the most but still its the lowest ranked of all 43 is just a punch under the belt if say 5 points is the belt i love the music performances the breakdancing makes me wanna spin ramo makes me wanna throw a piececmon its a classic
361,walter matthau and george burns were a famous vaudeville comedy act lewis and clark who havent spoken in over 10 years burns retired and matthau took it personally and has held a grudge ever since such is the premise of this hilarious neil simon play made into a movie of course what makes it so good is matthau and burns in their prime and the material is funnier than anything you can find today richard benjamin shines as matthaus nephew and agent theres even old clips of actual stars of the golden era to get you into the groove of the film and character actor fritz feld starts it all off with a pop rosetta lanoire who started out in the 30s in theater with orson welles and later was grandma on family matters is great in a small rolethe only problem i had with it and maybe im being too picky andor serious is the way matthau treats burns when they first meet granted hes had a lot of resentment festering in all these years but some of the things he does would be considered rude or just plain bad manners taken out of context also im used to seeing matthau act that way in other movies but not to george burns and matthaus bellowing tends to get a little old all in all if you need a consistently funny film to help and forget your troubles put in the sunshine boys theyll lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and way of lifebenjamin you have to slide it matthau wait wait i think you have to slide it
362,this is a very entertaining flick considering the budget and its length the storyline is hardly ever touched on in the movie world so it also brought a sense of novelty the acting was great pz to dom and the cinematography was also very well done i recommend this movie for anyone whos into thrillers it will not disappoint you
363,due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldnt believe how bad it was i didnt go and see this film at the cinema after watching it on dvd i have to say i regret that now im not saying it is brilliant but i would venture to say that it is a good movie i enjoyed itpeople have skulls thicker than neds helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary if you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal i dont think ganghis kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact what kind of man ned kelly actually was is a matter of debate and quite passionate it seems in spite of the efforts of governments and some historians ned kelly has become a legend legends are stories and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself ned kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of australian culture that doesnt trust or accept authority a society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushrangerso not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical kelly gang i actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie it was sentimental and romantic but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been for my fellow australians watch the lighthorseman and you will see what i mean it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas such as the shooting of the troopers ironically i actually enjoyed the movie because of that because it would be those details that most of the focus on neds story would dwell and they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historiansthis movie was always going to have a hard time having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market to pay the pills and the legend as it means to australians perhaps a little of neds spirit is in this movie because i think it rebelled against peoples expectations and unfortunately missed both targets fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film for me it was an unexpected kind of movie about ned and that is why i liked it orlando blooms performance did a lot for the movie too  he really added something i think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf for a changewhen you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered send me this on dvd for christmas rather than croc dundee or the man from snowy river anytime
364,one of director miike takashis very best its so good its difficult to put into words at nearly fifteen years older than the target audience it thrilled me from beginning to endit recalls similar childrens films from the 1980s in the sense that unlike today those films werent afraid to scare  theres a lot of nasty detail here that i initially found jarring but soon realised its nothing different to what i grew up on the film is a compilation of 80s kids films conventions you name it its there a young boy hero thrust from his own unhappydysfunctional world into another inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins a quest to save both worlds from an evil force a beautiful heroine he has a crush on a sadistic henchwoman gogo yubari from kill bill vol 1 a lead villain who draws his evil power from something everyone in the world can relate to but all these genre conventions are given a fresh spin and added depthone of the imdb reviews begins where was this film when i was a kid and its a sentiment i agree with wholeheartedly even while watching it i lamented the fact that i hadnt grown up on it that it wasnt a part of my childhood like labyrinth masters of the universe and to a much lesser extent the neverending story those films and others like the goonies are recalled but never copied  miike relentlessly offering us a new take on thingspoor cgi is a staple of many of his films sometimes due to budgetary limitations but just as frequently an artistic choice  a desire to present things in an outlandish way here the cgi is mostly average solely due to budgetary limitations but nevertheless he does a fantastic job of putting on a spectacle the cg effects combine with traditional puppets animatronics and truly extraordinary makeup to create a world filled with rich characters and characterisation that frequently borders on the visionarythis ranks as one of the greatest childrens films ever made not for younger or more sensitive kids thoughjust jawdroppingly wonderful see it for yourselves and if you think your kids can handleappreciate it then show it to them let them grow up on the great yokai war as some small compensation for the fact you couldnt
365,gespenster 2005 forms together with yella 2007 and jerichow 2008 the gespenstertrilogy of director christian petzold doubtless one of the cremedelacreme german movie directors of our timeroughly gespenster tells the story of a french woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in berlin  and has never been seen ever since then the mother keeps traveling to berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches by aid of timedilated photography for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age as we hear later in the movie the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter marie however this time when she meets nina everything comes quite differentthe movie does not bring solutions not even partsolutions and insofar it is rather disappointing we are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not if her actual daughter is still alive or not most disappointing is the end after what we have witnessed in the movie it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves nina alone the simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed can be a strong effect of dramaturgy fex in umberto d but in gespenster it is displacedsince critics have been suggesting freudian motives in this movie let me give my own attempt why is it that similar persons do not know one another especially not the persons that another similar person knows this is quite an insane question agreed from the standpoint of aristotelian logic according to which the notion of the individual holds the individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else so the aristotelian answer to my question is they do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change everybody who is not insane believes that however what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change eg scarfs on their left under ankle or a heartshaped birthmark under their right shoulderblade this is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made although i am not sure whether even the director has realized that despite our modern aristotelian world the superstition conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality and that individuality therefore is not something erratic but rather diffusional so that the borders between persons are open such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrationalism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking  a source of gespenster of the most interesting kind
366,a very good movie a classic scifi film with humor action and everything this movie offers a greater number of aliens we see the rebel alliance leaders and much of the imperial forces the emperor is somewhat an original character i liked the ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the vietnamese excellent references i loved the duel between vader and luke which is the best of the saga in return of the jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the empire finally falls i also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills vaders redemption and returns hi into anakin skywalker spirit along with yoda and obiwan it gives a sadness and a tear the greatest scenes in star wars are among this movie when vader turns on the emperor luke watches and finds comfort in seeing obiwan yoda andhis father 1997 version not hayden christenssen the next best scene is when luke rushes to strike back darth vader to protect leia there is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending i felt there was much more than meets the eye and as always the john williams music will bring the classicism into star wars universe
367,i dont understand why the other comments focus on mcconaughey he has never been a very interesting film actor the best part of this movie is the writing and the wit alfred molina and patrick mcgaw make an unusual comic duo definitely not stock types although one cant say their characters are well developed that doesnt make them any less funnythe version i saw was on hdnet and had subtitles for the spanish dialog so that was certainly not a problem the use of spanish gives it more authenticity a very underrated movie judging by the unusually low score imdb members have given it i thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least a lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting
368,a christmas together actually came before my time but ive been raised on john denver and the songs from this special were always my familys christmas music for years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was christmas a few years ago i was finally able to track down a video of it on ebay so after listening to all the music for some 21 years i got to see john and the muppets in action for myself if you ever get the chance its a lot of fungreat music heartwarming and cheesy its also interesting to see the 70s versions of the muppets and compare them to their newer versions today i believe denver actually took some heat for doing a show like thisi guess normally performers dont compromise their images by doing singalongs with the muppets but im glad he did even if you cant track down the video the soundtrack is worth it too it has some muppified traditional favorites but also some original denver tunes as well
369,peter bogdonavich has made a handful of truly great films and they all laughed is one of his best the cast couldnt be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy interestingly enough the witty light touch bogdonavich so effortlessly employs gives the film a rather disarming emotional core fresh and immediate the film starts with absolutely no explanation theres no soundtrack music to cue us we meet the characters in action and as bogdonavich glides down the streets of new york the film unfolds effortlessly robby mullers camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental but surely isnt the cast is terrific in every way a classic
370,being that i am a true product of the hiphop and electronic dance music generation this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time beat street although not as authentic in some respects as wild style is a film that is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban sampledjbased music and electroclub culturealthough i will admit that at times the dialogue is somewhat cheesy you cant help but feel for the characters and ultimately wish you were there for the beginnings of hiphop culture in new york city in the early eighties the bboy battle scene at the roxy nightclub a reallife realtime competition between the legendary rock steady crew and the nyc breakers is just as essential to a hiphop fans archives as any classic album watch some of the breakers moves in slowmotion if possible to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of a seasoned bboybgirl all praises due to the zulu nation
371,i liked this movie when the guy who was in on a bank heist of 40 million in gold dies his cell mate is used as bait to lead them to the hightech crazy killer partner by having a monitoring device implanted in his jaw without his knowledge its an action spy type film with enough comical scenes to keep it light it reminded me of enemy of the state well acted and good enough plot
372,i watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and i can say that i didnt have the best time mainly because i didnt know about ned kelly or his storybut since this is a biopic its important to at least know what to expect from the characteri dont know if the manner the events are told are true or if it everything is fictional but the way ned kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true i dont think hes portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief but thats just my opinionthis is a solid westerntype movie for everybodys tastes heath ledger is great as always and the sexy naomi watts charms the screengive this movie a chance if it airs on cable otherwise i dont think i could recommend it
373,i watched this in july and even with the christmas theme found it touching and sensitive it is not for someone with a realitymind as it is full of fantasy and lovely moments that sometimes dont make sense william russ did a grand job as hank i have only seen him in the remake of the long hot summer where he played a weak character but in this one the expression in his eyes throughout as hank considered the things that were happening to him was wonderful and tender valerie bertinelli was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role and peter falk as max was splendid and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes there were many special scenes including the one where hank realizes who max really was in his life its not for everyoneespecially those who arent into feelgood movies and this is definitely one if you like everything to be perfect and make sense avoid this one but i think it is wellworth rewatching which is why i taped it yes some of us still have vcrs 
374,i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotionalespecially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slowermoving was not as episodic and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movieit also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole i have heard many strange reasons such as a because yoda died b because bobba fett died c because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d because darth vader was revealedi would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely first off who cares if bobba fett died if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die dont get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fetts name judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think secondly many fans did not like yoda dying sure it was a momentous period in the movie i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic all the good guys cant stay alive in a realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not liking yodas death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy why was obi wans death okay but yodas not hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible that is utterly ridiculous i can not believe this one first off the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage they had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest the only thing they had was their blasters to add it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view and not only that the heroes  of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters the troopers must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strikes back the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers dont believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping landos base or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at somehow they missedas han solo and luke were trying to exit the death starthe last reason that i care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like darth vader being revealed well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father annakin skywalker it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his fathers face because it made it complete by annakins revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was annakin skywalker by removing the helmet the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about in fact thats is what i would have done in that scene too if i were lukes fatherisnt that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmeton another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse even if it is better that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be better or worse that the original  but i can not know for sure lets see that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really wasi am not sure who criticizes these movies but i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite that it is rotj i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleadingbottom line the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any dayfinally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as this movie stinks because luke is not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately
375,this film is one of the best shorts ive ever seen  and as i make it a point to be at all the major film festivals ive seen a lot especially of what the industry considers the best im not a fan of monaghan his acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me his only decent performance being in lost so i generally try to avoid his films i did however happen to see this at a film festival a few years back and was completely awed this director really knows what shes doing of course you are going to get the trolls or just ignorant people who dont understand what constitutes a good film and rip on low budget work because they have no idea what went into it but luckily from what ive seen they are in the minority when it comes to this gemlets not deny that the film was working on no budget and that a couple of the supporting actors could still use work because thats certainly true the production value is very low but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school pretend for a moment that the budget doesnt matter if you take away a bit of the acting the sound quality which actually wasnt the fault of the filmmaker i saw this at a festival and the sound was finei guarantee whoever made the dvd itself screwed up and the fact it was shot on minidv then what are you left with the story the visual composition and the soul of the film which are indisputably flawlessnanavati can tell a story that much is clear she can write substanceheavy engaging scripts better than most people in hollywood create a shot list that perfectly compliments that story and bring it to life in a fascinating creative way that were this higher budget might have won awards give it more experienced actors better sound postproduction and 35mm instead of minidv and even the trolls couldnt complain this girl is incredible and keeping in mind that insomniac was made a good few years ago shes done some amazing work since the trailer for dreams of an angel shows that and i cant wait to see the higher budget stuff shes done 910 stars this is one hell of a movie from one hell of a filmmaker
376,this film is in short a cinematic masterpiece the film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer the film opens during the spanish civil war as a group of children seek their revenge on another child in fact they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium here we see what life has wrought on each of them one is a reclusive sexually repressed patient another man is a hustler who has become ill the third child a young lady has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium this film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psychethis film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving the acting is excellent and the script is quite well written there is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film this is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience
377,i have never danced flamenco before but somehow i feel like this movie was perfect the colors how blatant the dances were the gypsies and the rivals all put together made a movie that seemed to have ended too soon i have seen other carlos saura movies and i agree that this film may be his best production i feel that the best characteristics of his past films were put together and aligned to make iberia i appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity going on behind the cameras while watching this movie i felt like i was sitting in a small restaurant in madrid comfortably watching the dancers bang on a wooden plank over a delicious fruit cocktail for me this movie fit like a glove i dont know how i will be able to get a copy of this film in the us in the next few years i recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the livelihood of other cultures it is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list
378,very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves i can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write this film simply smacked of the real world the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter the livein relatives and their quarrels the troubled child who gets knocked up and then typically drops out of school a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it 2 thumbs up
379,crush provides a combination of drama humor and such irony that i find the english establish very well when it concerns matters of the heart mostly known for directing john mckay wrote this wonderful screenplay about three fortysomething friends in a small town in england all three professional women downout of luck with men formed a ritual ladies night gathering with gin fags and sweets intake included with endless chatter of their dates erroneous behavior or the needs of their libidos andie macdowell once again thrown by the surrounds of the british which is where i find she exudes the most is absolutely charming as the head mistress of a prestigious school who becomes involved with a younger man small town gossip and the disapproving jealous friends great supporting cast conflicts with her relationship unfolding a series of brutal unfortunate events and showing us the many difficulties when one is in pursuit of true happiness keep in mind the main premise of this film is friendships and the ending shows us exactly that this is the type of film you either love or hate which is why i believe a lot of mix reviews and not that greatest success resulted when this film was released as im sure most are just unearthing the film now i very much enjoyed this film and highly recommend for those in the likes of such films as love actually and three weddings and a funeral not to mention the soundtrack is extraordinary perfectly capturing those crucial moments
380,europa or as it is also known zentropa is one of the most visually stunning films i have ever seen the blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless a true feast for the eyes the picture was a contender for a 1991s golden palm in canners the award went to barton fink by coen brothers a film stylistically very similar to zentropa heres an exercise in class rent both films and be a judge for yourself
381,one of the last classics of the french new wave for direction cineaste jean eustache drew from the simplicity of earlycentury cinema for story eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life so many things can be said of this film  observationally brilliant self indulgently overlong occasionally hilarious emotionally drainingetc etc in my mind whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths every film student writer or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no abrupt cuts no music video overstyling no soap operalike plot twists and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie everything is to be admired the writing concise clever surprisingly funny acting everyone quite simply is perfect in their respective roles and simple direction the viewer feels like a casual observer within the film make this film unforgettable this is undoubtedly a film that stays with you
382,this was a very good film i didnt go into it with very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the acting the script and the scenery miranda richardson was fantastic and so was joan plowright they stole the show but the other actors played their parts wonderfully also very enjoyable film
383,this movie surprised me some things were clicheish and some technological elements reminded me of the movie enemy of the state starring will smith but for the most part very entertaining good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo providing some comic relief this is a movie you can watch over againsay some wednesday night when nothing else is on i gave it a 9 for entertainment value
384,if you get it its magnificentif you dont its decentplease understand that getting it does not necessarily mean youve gone through a school shooting there is so much more to this movie that at times the school shooting becomes insignificantabove all its a movie about acceptance both superficiallyof a traumatic event but also of people who are different for whatever reasonits also a movie about unendurable pain and how different people endure it in this case the contrast between alicias rage and deannas obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat thankfully the audience is given credit for being human beings our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy implausibly moralistic endingabove and beyond that i try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that yet i must admit i cried like a lost little baby during this movie there were certain things about it that hit very close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed but that is not necessarily a bad thing
385,when i first found out that brian krause was going to be in this movie i wanted to watch it took me weeks to realize that ive seen the original of this and loved it so i had even more reason to watch well i watched it was actually better than most sequels for tv movies i hate what happens to brians character you can find out for yourself and i didnt like most of the characters brians one included but the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerklike characters to make stanley caldwell judd nelson shine once more at the end i was cheering for stanley and his own happy ending if you liked the original cabin by the lake or if you like horror movies without the blood id suggest you watch this
386,to many people beat street has inspired their lifestyle to something creative concerning the hip hop culturethe young lee is living in ny in the 80s when hip hop was at its beginning his a crew member of beat street a bboy crew the movie follows lee in his average day dancing graffitiing etcthe director has succeeded in making a movie with a plot and at the same time presenting hip hop to the rest of the world the movie has old school features such asafrika bambaataa  the soul sonic force grandmaster melle mel  the furious five the rock steady crew the new york city breakers and many moreneither the movie beat street nor the beat street spirit will ever die
387,i enjoy all the versions of this story but this one is my all time favorite george cscott gives a depth to the scrooge character that the others do not give the movie shows more about why he becomes so bitter the changes in scrooge appear gradually as he encounters the different ghosts and the incidents that they show him this movie has the best tiny tim by far he is the right age rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager as in the other films anthony walters still has all or most of his baby teeth david warner is wonderful as bob cratchit he is such a versatile actor he portrays a man who clearly loves his family he plays the role with dignity neither as a wimpy man cowering under scroogesthumb but as a man who gracefully puts up with it because he has a family to provide for susannah york and the other actors do a fine job of bringing the characters to life edward woodward is the best ghost of christmas present ive ever seen most often he is played as a jolly santa type character in this he shows anger at scrooges attitudes and really makes scrooge reconsider the costumes and the sets really bring the london of dickens time to life a wonderful movie
388,i have been a star trek fan for as long as i can remember when they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series i was very excitedthe premiere of enterprise was well worth the wait it was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters the nx01 enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to lovescott bakula was just superior as captain jonathan archer jolene blalock gave a commanding performance as subcommander tpol that it just two people of this wonderful new crew that is boldly going to take us into the great history of starfleetenterprise looks like its going to be a good series well worth watching and i recommend that watch it
389,the movie is just plain funmaybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of the ramones around the time the film was made ive watched the film over and over by myself and with friends and it is still fresh and funny at the risk of being too serious the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timelessand the film has some gem linesscenesreferences to how our permanent record in high school will follow us through life let me assure you ive been out of high school for uhhh some years and its not following methe famous static line im getting some staticnot as much as youre going to get as principal togar approachesthe school board member who is so decrepit hes attended by nursesthe nazi hall monitors love for a body search principal togar announcing i give you the final solution and burning the ramones records note records were what came before cds and of course joey ramone noting things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school followed by togar asking do your parents know youre ramonesjust one piece of advicedont look up where the stars are nowjoey ramone sadly died young dey young who was a major hottie in the film today reminds us we all agepj soles career never advanced as we might have expected marla rosenfield as one the other students apparently appeared only in this film one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film though i submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles and does anyone know what happened to dj don steele so watch and enjoydont thinkjust have fun
390,man oh man ive been foolishly procrastinating not the right term theres a long list to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so and news are marvellous labyrinthine spectaclefor any von triers follower both rigets element of crime dogville dancer in the dark the five obstructions etc europa is probably the differential for its greatness in visual terms everything is beautifully somber and claustrophobic you really get the feeling of being inside this imaginary nightmarish time warp taking from the masters of surreal cinema like bunuel bergman till noir films of the 40s with acidic drops of avantguard von trier leads the artfilm scene as the well intended totalitarian movie maker of nowadays his authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate issues without being irrational hits the nerve of the viewer with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical worldas utopian as it seems i do believe people like von trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect the day films and filmmakers that carry this sort of power are no longer necessary as a tool for reflection perhaps it could be the start of a new era the age of emotional control over our fears this is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and overbravo
391,well of course not women are overly sensitive and needy on average which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore though not pseudoartistically extravagantly or blatantly dwelt on unlike many of you i have only seen la maman et la putain twice as many good films i noticed my opinion of it improved after a second viewing all that i know is what i have seen and have yet to delve into further exploits until i myself have acquired the dvd i have yet to figure out precisely why i enjoy this movie so much but really what do i care why though im sure i could and will form some wonderful explanation all right so you may disagree perhaps it is a bit boring at times im not an expert the blonde reminds me of a lovely grushenka
392,i have to say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen i was bored and looked through the tv and found home room and it was already in about 5 min but i got hooked it was so interesting and moving it shows what can happen in anyones life i give it a 10 more if possible the director writer and actors did an amazing job i think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it it was great drama mystery and more i cried for hours i think that the director writer should write more movies like this one i loved it i didnt even know about this movie which is sad because it was so good i wish it could go in the movies for more people to see
393,although i was born in the year that this movie came out and had never heard of it until my junior year of high school 1996 when i saw it i became totally engrossed laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends were themtheir hair clothes and speech were outdated but the emotions and the desperation of each situation were so familiar i remember thinking how real it was and how i wished that they would make movies like that stillin fact i saw this movie the night after i had been at a crazy party not so unlike the one in jays house which had been crashed by what we considered the loser derelicts who hung out on the fringes of our crowd a world class bser and responsible mother figure type i identified immediately with jeanie i was also the one with a car although i had a little bit of madges insecurities floating around in there too my best friend was a deidre and her good friend from childhood was our anniewatching the scene when jeanie is in school or the one where her and her boyfriend break up and then she is telling madge how much she loved him felt like conversations and situations i had personally hadnow at the age of 27 i recently saw the movie again and felt a surge of emotions because it was like watching back a piece of my own youth though none of my friends died i think this is a must see for all girls 13 and up
394,cunningly interesting western from a director who had few peers in the genre much like other anthony mann pictures the far country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery both of which play out amongst some of manns peccadilloes like honour integrity betrayal and of course death the story sees fortune hunting partners jeff webster james stewart and ben tatum walter brennan travel to oregon territory with a herd of cattle aware of the blossoming goldboom they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a klondike town arriving in skagway they find selfappointed judge mr gannon john mcintire ready to meet out justice to webster on account of webster having fractured the law all be it with honest cause along the way in punishment gannon takes the partners herd from them but they steal them back and head across the canadian border to dawsonwith gannon and his men in hot pursuit here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involvedinteresting from start to finish the far country benefits greatly from james stewarts bubbling anti hero in waiting portrayal and manns slick direction of the tight borden chase script the cinematography from william h daniels is superlative tho not done any favours by current dvd prints and the film has a few surprises and a will he wont he core reeling the viewers in paying dividends on rewatches for hardened genre fans it still remains something of an essential viewing for first timers venturing into the wonderful yet dark western world of anthony mann and james stewart 810
395,so this made for tv film scores only a 76 on this site bah humbug without question this 1984 version of dickens classic tale is the best ever made and yes the hound has seen the 1951 version which was also good but not good enough the lack of color is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of that version although the acting was wonderfulgeorge c scott is simply incredible as ebenezer scrooge we all know the story of this stingy businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner then by three other spirits later on that evening scott is properly gruff as scrooge too gruff in fact for some critics who claim he is unable to project the newfound glee that he awakens to on christmas morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson but hey this is george c scott hes never going to go dancing down the street in a fit of joy he has too much dignity and his scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic mannerthe supporting performances are uniformly excellent as are the costumes music and scenery 19th century london comes to life in clive donners visionary style the film even borders on frightening in several scenes involving the spirits the important tale of morality shines through in every frame thoughyou wont often find this version aired on television anymore and that is a disappointment the 1984 version of a christmas carol should be a required part of every households celebration of the holiday when the decorations come out of the basement this film should find its way into the dvd player at least once during the season10 of 10 starsthe hound
396,i found this to be a soso romancedrama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it its not a hallmark hall of fametype family film with sleepingbeforemarriage considered normal behavior but considering it stars jane fonda and robert de niro i would have expected a lot rougher movie at least languagewise the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult thats the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but to be honest the film isnt that memorableits still a fairly mild nice tale that i would be happy to recommend
397,you know the people in the movie are in for it when kingsized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky in fact the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller and only lawyer chamberlain has the answer but hes too much the european rationalist i gather to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreamsdarkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from directorwriter peter weir already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in picnic at hanging rock 1975 here its the arcane world of the australian aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites something strange is going on inside the aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason yuppie lawyer chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white mans court but the more he looks into things the more mysterious things get and the more interested a strange old aboriginal man gets in him and then therere those scary dreams that come and go at odd timeswell structured screenplay deepens interest throughout one reason the movie works is the background normalcy of chamberlains wife and little daughters audiences can readily identify with them and when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework the normalcy begins to buckle and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide chamberlain underplays throughout especially during the underground discovery tour where i think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does after all its the picking up of the mask that holds the key i believe to the riddle yet his reaction doesnt really register the revelation of course the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now thirty years later in the film the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocuspocus but the subject itself remains a telling one one way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene a big white suv barrels past an aboriginal family leaving them in the historical dust the terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells yet its also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave perhaps theres something about past and future to think about hereanyway this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you
398,i liked this movies its a another yash raj film which you know will look good on screen all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice another rule of yash rajs film is that either hero or heroines have only one or none parent think back to all of those films mpk suman didnt have mom hmapk salman didnt have parents and final rule is that you are 90 likely to see alock nath cryingthe film is good too its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained there is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough the little kid heros nephew is well placed and deliver very good one liners the actress is very pretty but shy you wouldnt get that in real life this film doesnt have massively big happy families living in big house which i thou was a good idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films there will be lots of women crying at the end of the film there isnt a strong message from this film but its a good watch if you are married arranged marriagethe film will remind you of what you went through and if you are not it will inform and may be scare you overall a very good looking film no big plots or twists but a very gentle film very much like bollywood classic
399,documenting a documenter thats one way to describe keep the river on your right a modern cannibal tale this film follows anthropologist tobias schneebaum who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago first to west papua and then peru tobias is a fullbodied character a gay jewish artist anthropologist who eeks out a living on a cruise ship teaching gawking tourists about the cultures he has come to have a deep respect and understanding for author of several books documenting his time with both the asmat people of west papua and the cannibalistic amazonians in peru tobias has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become yet tobias constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch one can only hope to ever achieve and retain such humility themselvestobias makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in immersing himself in these two tribal societies has left him fundamentally changed this film challenges the notions of morality and naturalness eg nudity homosexuality cannibalism watch for the graphic circumcision scene when questioned as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally denounce his nonjudgmental nature asks why not who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong this little sleeper is a must watch for not only national geographic types but also those interested in the art of documentary making this film shows what can be done shot on video the editing provides a quiet revelation of tobias life that leaves you watching in fascination at times he despairs at being pushed by the film crew to make the emotional journey back especially considering his age and physical frailty we can be but grateful that tobias allowed the tables to be turned on himself perhaps sympathising with the desire to understand humanity and ones place in the world the filmmakers provide some moments of critical balance presenting for example one anthropologist who believes that tobias predetermined his findings of homosexuality in this case based on his personal interests that said you cant decide when to stop being shocked and when to take this man home for a cuddle move over river queen this is the best river ride ive taken in a while
400,although ive long been a fan of peter weir i hadnt watched any of his australian movies until i watched the last wave and it was a pleasant unpredictable surpriserichard chamberlain plays david a lawyer invited to defend five aborigines charged with murdering another aborigine for davids peers its a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence but david believes theres a mystery underneath the murder linked to tribal rituals as his investigation proceeds he learns not only things about his clients but about himself tooto reveal more would be to spoil one of the strangest movies ive ever seen i can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one will be expectingthere are many elements that make this a fascinating movie chamberlains acting for instance but also the performances by david gulpilil who plays a young aborigine who introduces david into tribal mysteries and nandjiwarra amagula who plays an old aborigine whos a spiritual guide the relationships between these three characters make the heart of the moviebut theres also the way weir suggests the supernatural in the movie david has dreams that warn him of the future australia is undergoing awful weather with storms hail falling and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing more than pollution but its also related to the case david is defending how its related is one of the great revelations of the movie out of little events weir manages to create an atmosphere of dread and oppression suggesting future horrors without really showing anythingcharles wains score is fantastic especially the use of the didgeridoo the photography is also quite good russell boyd weirs longtime dp who won an oscar in 2004 for master and commander depicts a dark creepy world full of mysteryi also find it remarkable that for a movie centered on aborigines it doesnt turn into an indictment against white culture or into a sappy celebration of the their traditions like dances with wolves or the last samurai this movie is too clever to be that simplisticsometimes it can be frustrating and it may upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything making sense but for those who dont mind some strangeness or ambiguity the last wave is a great movie to watch
401,stewart is a wyoming cattleman who dreams to make enough money to buy a small ranch in utah ranch his only real companion is his sidekick ben tatum the great walter brennan to accomplish that they drive the cattle clear to alaska and on to dawson in canadian territory where they sell themalong the way they meet the man who runs the goldcrazy town behind a dishonest lawman john mcintire he attempts to steal them the herd later in dawson mcintire and his gang reappear this time interfering with stewarts gold claim captured by manns camera in the wonderful scenery of the canadian rockies stewart is a thoughtful loner forced into violence by his need to get rid of the treacherous actions of a corrupt entrepreneur robbing local miners of their claimsin this entertaining beautiful western stewart has two leading ladies to struggle with ruth roman a bit too valuable to describe as a sexy woman resisting the worst vicissitudes of the territory and the more docile the french canadian girl corinne calvet who does create a nice portrait of a likable girl with the ability to form a judgment in spontaneous manner stewart is lost between the ostentatious saloon owner and the wifecandidate
402,this film is a bit reminiscent of the german film the neverending story because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero however due to far superior modern technology puppets and cgi are used to make an amazingly realistic looking worldone that will blow your socks off due to its realism and scopei enjoyed this film but boy was it a chore at first unfortunately for most westerners this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd however give it a chance dont think or try to understand everything you seejust allow the story to unfold and you will most likely enjoy the filmin many ways this is exactly the sort of advice id give to adults who watch miyazakis spirited away because it is very similar and features tons of yokai japanese mythical spirits the big differences between the two is that the great yokai war is liveaction and spirited away is much more childfriendly while i do think the great yokai war was intended mostly as a kids movie in the usa most parents would not want to show this to younger kids because its so violent scary and features some adult behaviors so who is the audience in the west well older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with nonwestern themes and composition this is a rather narrow audience indeed while you are watching look for all the strange little touches in fact you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time a few of the funny references i liked were the comment about gamera the scene that came with the comment kids dont try this at home as well as the use of kirin beer to allow a person to actually see the yokai hmmperhaps that scene should have also contained this warning by the way director takashi miike is a hard one to pin down stylistically other than to say that none of his stories ive seen have seemed normal some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and i hated them especially audition and ichi the killerwhereas some of them are magical and among the best films ive ever seen the happiness of the katakuris one thing for sure its hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction one way or the other
403,home room like zero day and elephant was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings but unlike the other two films home room focuses on two survivors not the shooters or those killed in the aftermath of a shooting making it less exploitive and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answersdont give up on this little film during the first 20 minutes it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected hill street blues episode it is lame but bear with it at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature i recommend skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenesthere is nothing here that you cant pick up from the remainder of the filmlike a lot of good little films this was creatively a oneman show as paul f ryan was both the writer and the director while this arrangement does not guarantee a good film it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features because the script of home room is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and insured that his vision made it onto the screenryan takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewers sentimentality tolerance he runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey the song sarah mclaughlins sweet surrender he goes out on and the amazing editing of the final minutethe other strength of the film is the casting of busy phillips alicia and erika christensen deanna as the main protagonists although phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and christensen her intelligent daughter of a good family they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before the family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to ryan what is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie alicia to the lone shooter if they ever recut and trim the film this side story should be condenseda story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and ryan could have easily steered this film into cliché and predictability but instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing sparring match slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability only to retreat back inside themselves deannas im dying inside line just tears you aparti cant think of a moment in any other film that i felt as intensely as that one she desperately needs a connection that alicia just as desperately resists deanna only makes progress when she retreats the viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never seems to happenultimately this not only generates a lot of suspense but leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses who brought them to lifethen again what do i know im only a child
404,a must for any punk rocker this is the movie that made the ramones a household name back in the early 1980s when it first appeared on premium cable stations this was one of the first and best of the american punk rock movies with a cult classic status up there with the rocky horror picture show originally the producers wanted cheap trick as the stars but the release of the live at budakon album had just made them superstars and too hot an item to be in a low budget movie very good luck for the ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market which sadly never happened until after the bands demise the band dee dee especially always disliked the movie through the 80s but the fans always loved and could recite most of the movie while waiting to get into ramones shows this movie like most classics is stupid fun with some classic ramones footage in their heyday dont expect more you wont find it its great fun so enjoy it another allan arkush classic movie in a similar vein is get crazy featuring lee ving from the legendary hardcore punk band fear
405,a river runs through it is one of those movies that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can be truly appreciated the acting is wonderful and understated with every gesture and smile and nod carrying meaning brad pitt gives a radiant performance and tom skerrit is powerful as the preacher father the movie moves like a river you have to be willing to follow it through ebbs and flows but it is well worth it in the end
406,why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome everyone should know what an excellent movie this is it is engaging and funny from moment one original and wellacted i wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it deservesfor anyone that loved the princess bride labyrinth and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure this is one of the great ones robert deniro is hysterical relative newcomer charlie cox is an incredible leading man claire danes is fantastic as always michelle pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen there are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characterseven down to facial expressions
407,this is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great maybe this is because gorris takes nabokovs initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation the final consequence is a point of view over luzhin which dignifies him more than the nabokovs onethe only thing in the movie which i dont like is the influence of valentinovs on luzhins destiny i cant imagine nabokov creating a person like valentinov and giving him so great influence on novels argument
408,dirty sanchez is the more extreme british version of jackass in which the four boys pritchard dainton joycey and pancho go to great lengths to hurt and humiliate each other the reason this show is better than jackass is because most of the stunts are not planned which makes the reaction much more funny there are 3 series of the show the first follows them around and takes a long look at their lives eg theres an episode on their love livesjobs etc the second series sends the boys to try out different occupations the third follows their european tour it seems that the boys get more and more daring as the show progresses through the series in my opinion the third series is the best but trust me when i say if you have a week stomach do not watch as you are lightly to see a fair amount of blood and puke in every episode
409,as a habit i always like to read through the hated it reviews of any given movie especially one that id want to comment on and its not so much a pointcounterpoint sorta deal i just like to see what people say on the flipsidehowever i do want to address one thing many people that hated it called it to paraphrase beautiful but shallow some even going so far as to say that norms desire yet inability to help his brother was a mundane plot at bestid like to disagreeas a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction i can relate daily you see them abuse themselves knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to selfdestruction and its not about the specifics of what they did when how or why paul decided to take up gambling and associating with questionable folks its really more how they are wired on one hand they are veritable geniuses and on the other painfully selfdestructive its a lot like people like howard hughes  the same forces which drive them are the same forces which tear them apart and all the while you see this you know this and whats worse you realize you cant do a damn thing about itfor norman maclean a river runs through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur and who was to blame in the end no one is and often there is no why but it takes a great deal of personal anguish to truly come to this realization sometimes it takes a lifetime and sometimes it never comes at all
410,home room was a great movie if youve ever had drama in your life it keeps you wanting to see more wondering what the secret alicia is hiding i think i watched that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest plus i usually dont cry over movies but this one made me cry each time i wish i could find more movies like that one all in all i thought it was a great movie the more you watch of it the more you become part of it the very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma because it had her daughters name on it my heart felt as if it had shattered just then and how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadnt gotten hers yet i loved it so much
411,perspective is a good thing since the release of star wars episode i the phantom menace claims and counterclaims of just how episodes ii and iii will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the original star wars films making them part of a cohesive whole rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies what the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films this new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy return of the jedi often derided for its overly cute factor rotj is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect the empire strikes back indeed the cute element of rotj namely the ewoks remains a weak link in the entire series did george lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities only he can answer that questionthis cute factor aside the film is a brilliant full circle and evolution of the saga following on from the conclusion of the empire strikes back luke skywalker mark hamill follows his rebel alliance friends to tatooine his home planet to rescue han solo harrison ford the space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by jabba the hutt for overdue debtsskywalker is a changed man since leaving tatooine with ben obi wan kenobi alec guiness to fight the evil empire now swathed all in black lukes discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn his psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest while he might aim to always assist his rebel friends he yearns for another chance to confront the evil darth vader again despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the dark side and join vader at the emperors sideearly scenes in tatooine are impressive from jabbas lair to his floating palace and the almighty sarlac  an intenstine that lives in the sand lucas cgi enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the sarlac making it look fake and overdonethe battle scene on tatooine is outstanding and is one of the more memorable of the saga luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates jabba and his cronies proving his prowess as a jedi is now almost completewhen luke returns to the degobah system to visit the ailing yoda one more time the viewer is let down by yodas distinct lack of screentime undoubtably the star of the empire strikes back yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of lukes destiny is played out on screenrotj really is lukes film perhaps even more so than the original his journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with darth vader and his fate the other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow the romance between leia carrie fisher and solo is all but nonexistant unlike in empire in fact only leias character is developed in rotj solos character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two filmstheir roles are consigned to working alongside the rebels to destroy an all new death star that nears completion this time the emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction the empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all while the emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful skywalker to his side to work alongside or is that replace darth vader the emperor is a different kind of evil for this film less cunning than governor tarkin peter cushing from star wars more deeply psychologically dark than anything else played brilliantly by ian mcdiarmid the emperor is just one of those characters you love to hateall the other actors are well entrenched in their roles hamill surprises as the more wisened luke making his characters progression from whiny teenager impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series fords role is waring thin as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films  he was the real star of the first film after all fishers leia is more of a prop at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about add in favourites like alec guiness as kenobi yoda and the loveable chewbacca c3po and r2d2 and the series resembles a family more than a castdespite the films corny forest battle involving the ewoks and the empire it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence on endor in space and on the death star each with very impressive special effects the music as always is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance just as the blue danube worked perfectly for 2001 a space odyssey john williams score is as much a part of star wars folklore as light sabers and the forcelucas left the ending open to interpretation meaning there could have been more episodes made indeed scifi fans have created their own versions of episodes vii viii and ix in their heads over and over again rotj works when given a chance and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the serieswhen all six episodes get to be viewed together this saga could well be the best ever made is it already the addition of episode i changed the landscape of the series this is why return of the jedi can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release
412,unfortunately jean eustache 19381981 belongs like so many once leading french film makers nowadays to the great unknown ones whose movies are hard to find and are not released on international dvds since we have a good oldfashioned videostore in tucson i had the chance to watch this 3 12hour marathon masterwork that is not boring for ten secondssince we speak here about one of the most discussed and most controversially discussed movies of all times let me tell you my impression that the endless dialogs originally typical for the early nouvelle vague of a jacques rivette or alain resnais appear almost ridiculous in this movie the dialogs are basically monologues mainly the longest ones spoken by jeanpierre léaud the most characteristic feature is that the intersections of the speeches of two people is almost zero léaud or his character alexandre pleases to tell more about himself than about the topics he is seemingly to speak therefore one can hardly speak about communication in this movie it is well possible that the director had a gargantuan satire in mind against the idle running of the once so hotly discussed political and sociological ideas but the type of man alexandre exists to all times we find him already in petrons satiricon which work has actually great resemblance with the mother and the whorealexandre does not only nothing but he has developed an own kind of metaphysics about the absence of acting at least acting in the sense of responsibility toward the society whose part he is he mocks at the people who run to work at 7 cclock in the morning when he is just busy having his last drink before he goes to bed in the apartment of one of his girlfriends from whose money he lives he is unable to speak one sentence without quoting one of the leading thinkers between nietzsche and bernanos especially sartre who is shown quickly in the french intellectual café aux deux magots where alexandre too is sitting all day must serve as excuse for the lifestyle of alexandre and his colleagues because they suffer existential crisis from bourgeois nausea however the intellectual speeches of alexandre seem to be rather pseudointellectual and the sentences and quips he cites seem to come rather from a dictionary of quotations than from his actual reading of the respective booksit is true this movie demands an extremely broad european knowledge especially the connoisseurship of french existentialist philosophy and there consequences to the 68 student revolution movement but if you have this knowledge than you will enjoy 215 minutes of your life by staring amazed into the tv and crying out with laughing like you have probably not done it since a long time
413,this movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it you dont need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didnt close down a café to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future
414,carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids when she finds herself overloaded at work she is able to hire paul to help her out paul is just out of jail and his past is not entirely behind him to say too much more about the story which has many twists would be a mistakethe most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when carla can hear and when she cant  a sort of point of hear like point of view the early scenes that set this up as well as the early character development of carla and paul was more interesting to me than the twists and turns later on some of which were hard to follow andor stretched credibility a bit there is also some unpleasant violence back to the positive side the cinematography was very goodthe film is worth seeing but perhaps not seeking out seen at the san francisco international film festival on 4282002
415,ok im biased i live near shrewsbury in england where this wonderful movie was filmed it still looks the same now i remember them filming here quite vividly and the fake snow on the streets for days on end often when im walking through shrewsbury i see a street or a house and it will remind me of this filmgeorge c scotts scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions his physical appearance isnt the typical miser scotts is big and imposing a man who finds those smaller than himself to be inferiorwe all know the story and the quotes the book is one of the most cherished works in the english language and i dont believe there are many cynics who would say that people arent capable of change and redemption this film version portrays all of that quite beautifully george c scott may be american but he plays the part of the english miser with wonderful skilli love this movie if you havent seen this version i would strongly urge that you do its usually available for a very small amount of money or are you too mean
416,i remember that the trailer for legend of zu was quite impressive and being a fan of a man called hero my all time favourite storm riders i decided that i must watch this one too i know that there is way to much critcism on ekin chengs acting ability everywhere but he is my favourite hong kong moviestar so far way better than nicolas tse neverthelessand he is one of the factors that i enjoyed this movie without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end i even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this film they must have put a lot of work into this one and they deserve good credit for that the storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a love story thrown in i guess ekin cheng pulls the girls easilythe story is not very intellectual and deep but that is not what you expect when watcing an action movie i wished there were more martial arts action with fists and fist instead of battles with magical abilities but well thats life and it never goes the way you want it to and why did they sound like supersonic planes in the battle through the sky in the end  thats way too funny legend of zu cannot be a man called hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and that is not a bad thing at all if a company decides to publish games on this movie i will not get suprised as it carries all the videogames elements good work please make more fantasy movies like this
417,the performances were superb the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a victorian living historian i was impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detaili wouldnt say you need any knowledge of the kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge do not expect as some rather silly people do any of the characters to have the auzzie accent as we know it it was at that time a country during infancyok the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film gregor jordan said in the extra feature on the dvd that he wanted his movie to inspire an interest and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up heresee it and you will not be sorry
418,the ramones whom i consider the founders of modern punk rock lend their thenunique sounds to a terrifically twisted movie about a rowdy rock fan pj soles who faces off against a merciless joyless principal mary woronov for the right to rockfeaturing a soundtrack brimming with incredible music rrhs is fascinating in concept and execution its chock full of riotous sight gags like the mouse experiment teenage spirit probably my alltime favorite film opening and bizarre offthewall moments the straitjacket scenes if youre looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun on a molecular level look no further but if youre looking for a nice dignified dramatic epic maybe you should look a wee bit furtherhi everybody im riff randell and this is rock  roll high school

420,legend of zui remember well tsui harks original zu warriors made 18 years earlier over one christmas on a rare week when channel 4 in the uk showed a week of hong kong movies zu warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable that its been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprogin fact i think the original zu warriors is one of the earliest films i saw as a kid that i can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from and the memories of seeing yuen biao sammo hung and others in their classic primeso when i saw this remake of zu warriors there was a feeling of apprehension could it beat the dreamy childhood memories i had of the original or will it follow the road of other remakes and die a death more horrible than the baddies and their broken necks you find in those kung fu movieswell the answer is i cant say but that was because this isnt really a remake the stories and styles are almost completely differentthe legend of zu tells of the story of king sky a lone warrior whose master dawn declares her love for him but her life is taken from her by a monster called insomnia two hundred years later insomnia returns dawn is reincarnated as enigma and insomnia has returned to destroy zu meanwhile white eyebrows and red try with the help of king sky to stop insomniathe plot isnt one full of twists and turns but had enough detail in it to keep me interested but i can see this film as one you either love or you hate the film is very much about the special effects with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments much like the storm riders and a man called hero but unlike the other two this film was one which didnt overdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful nothing appears rushed  unlike hero the backgrounds were complementary to the acting and not at all overpowering the scenesthe story also involves plenty of characters and the intermingling of so many individuals does make the film intriguing it was possibly on the verge of too many cooks but generally each character had its part in the story but some of the roles appear to be extended cameos in my opinion and i somehow am left to slightly question the necessity of thisekin cheng and louis koo play very central roles in the film but i couldnt say this film showed their best performances cecilia cheung appears to at least have matured in her acting but it is still quite raw kelly lin was the new revelation for me despite her very short role i have apologise and admit to oglingoverall i have to say did enjoy this film as much as i enjoyed the original given that both movies are made by the legendary tsui hark the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in hong kong has changed over two decades and one beauty of that is the fact that you cant really compare the two films at all as much as apples are apples and pears are pearsultimately both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right and im going back to reminisce by watching the original againtwo to watch but not compare
421,the last wave is never going to win over the mainstream audience it is a slowmoving but fascinating film for those who are willing to go along with it an australian properties lawyer is asked to take on the case of five aborigines accused in the murder of one of their own all sorts of portents and omens soon pop up as the mans death involves a tribal issue that was not meant for white mans court and pretty soon the lawyer is having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy it looks like the end of the world may be at hand and he and the aborigines may know this but no one else does richard chamberlain as the lawyer is at his peak here david guptil a familiar face from several other australian flicks and a decent actor is one of the five aborigines on trial the last wave is simply not for everyone anymore than is magnolia both happen to have strange things falling from the sky check it out on a slow saturday night
422,a lot people get hung up on this films tag as a childrens film and that it certainly is though it is one made for adults takashi miike uses the fantasy genre particularly the childrens fantasy genre as a springboard into the wild territory that is the great yokai warthe setup is simple a boy is selected to play the hero in this years annual festival only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined what follows is a hallucinatory grotesque whimsical and often funny journey through the world of japanese folklore but wait theres also an evil villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world however the villain here is not a mere demon it is the demonspirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans use and discard usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hateresentment the villain transforms the vibrant colorful yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coalsthose whove played the video game sonic the hedghog might remember a certain dr robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddlys who sonic had to then liberatethe hero in this film is actually the least interesting character essentially playing the straight man in a world gone suddenly mad though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers as do many of the yokia themselves who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots some spirits being umbrellas with eyes talking walls or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beansof course in this magical world of miikes yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in themin several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of childrens fantasy as few if any of the characters are heroic their victory being a combination of happenstance almost arbitrary faith and a desire to party the yokai spirits only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout after they mistake the end of the world invasion of earth for a great yokai festival and even then only to dance and party also the film ends not with the usual celebratory alls well that ends well fantasy ending but with a final scene showing our hero years older with an adult job now unable to see the yokai spirits of his youth who then despondently turn to the villain who being a spirit can never really die this ending with its yokai spirit who is the spitting image of pokemons pikachu warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves but of the horrors of overconsumption the villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around themin japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence they become soulless vengeful machines not unlike those seen in modern video games suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die but can become deformedthis is one of the first scripts miike has contributed to and i believe it shows as theres a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness though ive focused mostly on the story since lots of users here seem to write it off i do want to say that visually its a kaleidescope of cgi stop animation costume and live puppetry that works remarkably well theres a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film and the miyazaki comparisons are warranted as are the neverending story and labrynth comparisons though this film is sharper and more adult than either the yokai are beaten brutalized and turned into machines of living hate who i believe even kill a few humans a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening while a sexual undercurrent the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes especially when considering this is a childrens film however these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough not to traumatize any children to bad grims fairy tales before revisions did much worse far more oftenall and all this is one of miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet with enough visual drama and great performancesthe yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them thats laugh out loud funny at times to appeal to audiences of all ages and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth the latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood another beautiful funny and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasnt come close to his apex instant classic
423,the sunshine boys was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of neil simons play about a retired vaudevillian team played by walter matthau and george burns who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that the problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other richard benjamin appears as matthaus nephew a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality this warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainmentvaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of neil simons better screenplays and outstanding work by matthau burns and benjamin burns won the best supporting actor oscar for this but i think matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as willy clark matthau was nominated for best actor but didnt stand a chance against nicholson for one flew over the cuckoos nest however in another year this was an oscarworthy performance matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance the scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and cant get the name of the product right is a classic the sunshine boys is a warm and winning neil simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between matthau and burns
424,when i was told of this movie i thought it would be another chick flick i was wrong this movie sends a powerful message about judging others i was deeply moved everyone i have encountered i have recommended this movie to no one has come back saying it was bad busy also did a great job with her role in this film i dont know much about her acting career but wow they way she pulled off the end of this fill was greatat the beginning it was a little slow but after she went to the hospitalwow the movie picks up again i have no idea why this movie hasnt been spoken of in the movie world my wish would be for this movie to be released again and advertised morebecause it sends a powerful message in a mere hour and a half
425,film is designed to affect the audience and this film left me speechless gorgeously photographed and well acted with dialog that approaches poetry the film involves lust hate murder rape theft and deception it weaves an intense web that left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the closing credits the story is sweeping it takes the audience from the atrocities of the spanish civil war to the human wreckage left behind roger casamajor and bruno bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen supporting players are excellently cast and lend a real sense of authenticity sets lighting scenery and cinematography are wonderful i absolutely love the photography

427,all the talent mr sooraj barjatya showed in his first 3 movies i thought were all an accident because his 4th one main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad but i have to say it wasnt an accident this guy is talented and the way he has done vivah is just brilliant right from the first scene it affects you the sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome the chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between srk and kajol as usual alok nath as the good and loving father is fantastic so is anupam kher but its a shahidamrita filmamrita looks good in most scenes though shahid does look a little young to get married but he does a good job of a shy but yet morally strong groom this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life all in all a brilliant film hats off to mr sooraj barjatya

429,the turning point in the matador comes about half through the movie when danny an unsophisticated man from denver is sitting in the balcony of his mexico city hotel enjoying a quiet moment someone knocks on his door and knowing its julian the paid assassin he refuses to answer but did he really richard shephard the director of the matador presents us with a character julian noble who shows no redeemable qualities in fact we have already seen him in action doing what he does best when julian meets danny at the bar of the camino real in mexico city he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a livingdanny who has come to sell his program to a mexican company but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter julian its not until some time later on a cold winter night that the killer appears at dannys door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to tucson its at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected waypierce brosnan acting against type makes a great contribution with his irreverent julian noble just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character greg kinnear on the other hand plays the straight part of this odd couple hope davis appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why didnt she stay longer philip baker hall puts an appearance as the liaison between julian and his assignmentsrichard shephard directs with style working with his own material the musical score is by rolfe kent and the crisp cinematography of david tattersall enhances everything

431,a film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker the fact is steven spielberg probably our greatest storyteller has been doing this in various movie formats for years the color purple at the time was considered risky especially after action classics like jaws and raiders of the lost ark in hindsight this film should have come as no surprise for spielberg had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in et critics called color purple his entrance into intellectual fare it is quite an entrance no special effects no swashbuckling just brilliant storytelling based on a literary classic by alice walker one surprise is how spielberg could present such a moving film about africanamericans in the deep south slavery is gone but in the south depicted here it seems as though blacks are using other blacks as slaves spielberg is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience this is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations it is the first in a line of films people either didnt see or wouldnt see because there are no aliens empire of the sun always schindlers list etc his awesome talent is obvious with this specific picture because a he uses mostly untrained firsttime actors b he tackles a subject most felt was unadaptable to the screen and c it is pure drama with no strings pulled where characters grow and change over the passage of roughly 30 years it is almost epiclike in look and scope and the fact that it did not garner a single academy award from 11 nominations is a travesty and an insultwhoopi goldberg is fabulous as the tortured celie an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive danny glover who she only knows as mister the film follows a path of occasional beatings and mental torture she goes through while with mister the pg13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the walker novel this is not the burning bed in georgia by any means there is no blatant revenge taken as might be expected it happens gracefully goldberg perfectly plays a human being someone in need of love and someone who deserves it the films most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when goldberg and her sister nettie played by akosua busia are separated maybe forever possibly foreshadowing holocaust separation of child and parent you may have to check for a pulse if you are not moved by this sequencethe color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people there really is something to live for but love triumphs over all spielberg bashers take note the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliensrating 10 of 10

434,in our household we are enormous fans of a christmas carol and watch virtually every version each christmas including the old 1938 reginald owen and the modern 1999 patrick stewart our overall favorite is the 1951 black  white classic because alastair sim is ebeneezer scrooge and his conversion rings the truest however this 1984 rendition has its own unique merits and makes a lovely  entertaining story quite faithful generally to dickens novel see my comments on the other film adaptations if interestedfirst of all george c scott can certainly seem pretty crotchety and doesnt make a bad scrooge i adore his sideburns his long topcoat  hat he cuts the finest fashion figure of the lot and quite a handsome gentleman however sometimes it seems scott is enjoying his role as scrooge just a wee bit too much and not taking it quite as seriously as he oughtthis rendition has the best overall christmas atmosphere hopeful and optimistic somehow you know this story is going to have a happy ending filmed in the town of shrewsbury england it just seems somehow very british the film has a lovely musical score with wonderful lively caroling music throughout all the appropriate portions of the tale sometimes i could almost smell the chestnuts roasting and the pudding singing in the copper marleys anguished ghost with his wonderful jaw dropping scene and the three spirits are all quite convincing christmas past is a lovely ethereal lady christmas present wonderfully giant and jovial christmas yet to come shrouded and foreboding as always however i found scrooges nephew fred a wee bit quiet  grim not nearly as jolly  hearty as he should be i like the nephews wife whom theyve named janet with her lovely sprightly period hairstyle instead of blind mans bluff theyve concocted a game called similes for the nephews christmas dinner party which is a cute little touch scrooge getting right into the spirit of the thingthe cratchits and their somewhat meagre though much appreciated christmas dinner are well depicted with bob david warner suitably sympathetic and longsuffering in his miles of scarf mrs cratchit is charmingly portrayed by susannah york who also starred with george c scott in the wonderful 1970 adaptation of jane eyre above all this version has unquestionably the best tiny tim not only an adorable  endearing little waif but sickly with those dark circles under his eyes the frail wee thing looks unlikely to survive the hourthis is a delightful  heartwarming version of the holiday classic with its festive atmosphere its sure to put you in the spirit of the season
435,this is a feelgood movie and nothing more and for that it is great fun to watch sure it skims over political issues but so what i am sure she wasnt trying to make good night and good luck here lets not try to make it anything else but what it islight fare and very enjoyable at thatdo we remember what 1984 was like weve become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not i tend to differ on this point goldie knew this was funfluff and she went ahead and did itlike her lightest fare protocol overboard housesitter wildcats private benjamin seems like old times foul play death becomes her first wives club and the remake of outoftowners goldie knows what she is doingshe plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it goldie just knows herself really well and she knows what she can do really wellshe has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently i loved her in laughin and every thing shes ever been in she has never tried to be anything else but who she isand thats that bubbling giggly girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and youve just got to lighten up because before you know ityou are old wrinkled and suffering from one of lifes inevitable ailments if it even comes that latei appreciate goldie for what she is a lovable comic actress
436,take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where theyll be tempted by 26 singles this was the premise of the show simple yet outrageous  funny leave it to fox to throw morality out the window  let the debauchery flow it was like a reallife version of melrose place the good thing about the show is that it wasnt about people conniving  manipulating each other for a cash prize it was about lust  temptation pure and simple  the ultimate test for a relationshippeople either loved the show or hated it it was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident you know you shouldnt watch but you cant help but look drama aside there was a lot of eye candy
437,two years ago i watched the matador in cinema and i loved everything about this movie obviously i was totally under impression of pierce brosans magnificent role yesterday i caught this movie again on tv so i looked at it a bit deeper now i can say with certain that this movie isnt that special but you just gotta love it because of one man brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of julian noble tired hitman who has no friends soon julian meets danny wright greg kinnear in mexico city man whos got bad luck his son died in accident his job isnt going that well and hes not sure that he can keep his wife bean hope davisi always liked movies like this crime movie with big touch of humor mostly that humor comes from brosnan as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d or one of my favorite lines in this movie i look like a bangkok hooker on a sunday morning after the navys left town brosnan says it with his charm while hes drinking his margarita as usually i also like greg typical american face kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like danny wrightso i recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of brosnan ever hell make you smile and admire him at the same time great brosnan in not equally great movie
438,yeah right sammo hung already acted in the main role in 1983s zu warrios from the magic mountain now 2001 he does it again with zu warriors but this time he finally does it right you seldom see him in wuxia more often in classic eastern or crime slapstick but this role simply does fit him the ancient chinese legend about zu mountain is not often represented in movies as far as i know about movies translated for the west although the legend contains a vast of interesting stories and possibilities straight said you havent seen a story alike yet in a modern movie and that makes it so great and wow all the colors plus the enormously deep rightintotheheart going story makes you fall for this movie in an instant the first time i watched it i had to watch it again instantly and i did ok true i didnt understand all of it the first time but that makes it only better you know you didnt understand all of it because there is so much spice in it therefor it is a pleasure for one self to watch it over and over again and yeah it grows deeper in your heart the more often you watch itsummary a story to love characters you cry with and truly a movie you never forget  editors note well i think i must watch it right now again d
439,one of the better kung fu movies but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews the movie starts out well enough with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier which is rarer than youd think for this era and make the nonfight dialogue sequences passable for a kung fu movie this is a great compliment unlike other chinese action movies which were always period pieces or in the wake of jackie chans police story i cop dramas pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china unfortunately in the latter 13 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessarythe action is overall good featuring a duel between sammo and 12 of the shaw brothers only 2 stars karleung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet lis bad guy theres only 20 minutes of combat here which is standard but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other but there are smooth edits and then theres this it really takes away from the fights when its this obvious the footage was messed withthat said if you like kung fu movies my opinion here wont dissuade you and if you dont you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this
440,i love all of the movies by michael landon jr and michael landon jrs casting of dale midkiff as clark daviscould not of been any better dale midkiff has the ways to pull off this characterthis movie kept me spellbound from start to finishthe death of missie  willies baby girl with the timing of clarks visit was only gods timing how they dealt with the death and how clark helped them do so was that of a fathers lovealthough there are 3 movies before this one  love comes softly  loves enduring promise  loves long journey i feel you can see this movie and understand it easily yet leave and want to see the previous 3 movies due to the history all the characters have behind themmichael landon jr is an excellent directori look forward to many more movies from him in the future
441,this remarkable film can be summed up very easily first of all while the comparisons to princess bride are inevitable its almost futile to do so while both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop stardust is so much different than any other fantasyscifi film ive ever seen its such a hybrid of those genres but its plot and script are so unique thatalong with the performances special effects cinematography and scorethe finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen secondly the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist thirdly i did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way in fact the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch wonderfully casted and superbly acted across the board this fantasy adventure with scifi elements was the best one ive seen since return of the king not that i am comparing the two at all ok so its not that easy to sum up but dont let any crude andor heartless and cynical review nor the films pathetic pr prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer or even possibly in a long time
442,dear readersthe final battle between the rebellion and empire the second death star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the rebel alliance luke skywalker now a jedi knight returns from tatooine with han solo and princess leia now revealed as lukes twin sister they agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on the forest moon of endor while lando calrissian leads the attack on the death star little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the emperor palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the second death starreturn of the jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy its got action drama romance great battles fantastic acting amazing fight scenes and awesome music by john williams mark hamill is fully matured now into a jedi knight gone is the naive farmboy and in his place is a calm relaxed jedi determined to save the galaxy leia is still cool in this film as well as han and lando 3p0 r2 and chewie do their roles to a t while james earl jones still is cinemas greatest villain darth vader ian mcdiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless emperor palpatine the action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty john williamss score is still cool and enhances the film by several levelssigned the constant dvd collector
443,i thought this was one of those really great films to see with a bunch of close friends i laughed and cried and laughed and cried at the same time it was just really touching although not a new concept this was a very well made film
444,i am glad other people enjoyed this movie cause i know it doesnt have the greatest reputation and it made no money at the box office i thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why  bogdanovich directs with the lightest of touches the cast especially coleen camp is perfect and the big bad apple never looked better on film youve seen worse movies
445,alright this film is the representation of several things for starters this film is about a disgruntled student who brings a gun to school and shoots roughly 9 students one student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries the lead character is what several people who consider a lonergoth despite the movies stating of her not being so she seems quite mysterious but was also the only unharmed student in the victimized classroom shes questioned due to having a history of knowing the shooter and having a record of being on the phone with him the night before anyhow shes a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society yet due to some at first unexplained events she spent roughly a year out of school failing the grade she has the desire to graduate and the principle practically cons her into the only possible way she can pass is to spend time with the survivor the girl in the hospitalthese two leads are nearly entirely opposite and they are quite that on a social level while alisha is a quiet inwardly disturbed antisocial goth girl who spends her time entirely alone even though she seems to read quite often somewhat of a closetout of the closet bookworm the other girl is a rich popular bubbly girl who seems always incredibly optimistic and trapped in her own fantasy world ignoring the outside world and its realism to survive i feel both of these roles to a marvelous job of representing most cliques in the modern highschool but more importantly shows how two entirely opposite girls who know nothing of each other eventually open to each other while the injured girl learns a deep meaningful truth on her once sheltered life and the outside world alisha learns that complete abandonment of society and locking everything inside is not always the best thingmany people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things either a snobby hateful girl who wants he rest of the world to suffer as she does taking it out on an innocent girl or the story of a seemingly trapped fantasized girl who meets an outcast to society and learns not only not to judge but that she is actually perhaps one of the most intelligent people shes known in other words people may see this film as a focus on alisha teaching the other girl a lesson about life but it isnt about thatthis film is about several things while it is about all i have stated it is also representative of how people deal from a large lifechanging catastrophe truly this movie is not very symbolic but instead incredibly straight forward with its message as long as you arent afraid to open your mind and your heart to some emotions you may not be familiar with being portrayed so miraculouslyoverall this film is one of the best ive ever seen the acting is brilliant the storyline and representation is deep and meaningful and the emotion flowing throughout this film will have anyone not only relating but possibly crying this film is by far heartwrenching and very impactful and if i ever believed any film could alter a persons life this would be the first that could have changed minei adored this movie if you ever want a movie thats moving and impactful while incredibly entertaining and real watch this
446,despite the feelings of most star wars fans in my opinion return of the jedi is the greatest cinematic film ever created ever since the first time i saw it its depth intensity special effects and moving story have overwhelmed me the film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years filled with powerful action as the climax of the original trilogy george lucas gives us a rousing finish of the star wars saga in jedifilm summary contains spoilers for those who have not seen itafter the empire strikes back left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in return of the jedi darth vader in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted death star to oversee its construction the emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker to the dark side luke lando leia chewie and the droids all travel to tatooine to rescue the frozen han solo from the crime lord jabba the hutt after han has been rescued and jabba defeated luke returns to dagobah to find a dying yoda where he learns the awful truth darth vader is in fact his father the rebel heroes regroup with the rebel fleet now joined by other species and races including the mon calamari the rebels must make a allornothing plan of attack to destroy the death star before it is completed while lando heads the space attack in the millennium falcon the rebel heroes must disable the death stars shield generator on the forest moon of endor it is here that the rebels happen upon the furry but mighty ewoks during the the two part intense battle a third battle must take place as luke willingly delivers himself to vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the dark side in emotionally charged sequences luke must face his father as the emperor lures out his dark emotions as young skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of palpatine vader turns on his wicked master to save his sons life filled with a deep timeless story of good vs evil return of the jedi is a spectacular emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us
447,the film begins with vincent price about to begin his performance as a magician however midway through the very successful show the police come and shut him down it seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks price had createdeven those he made on his own time at home as a result price justifiably kills the evil man the problem is that while the viewer understood why price killed and most probably thought this was a good thing because price was a bit mad he just couldnt stop at one sort of like eating lays potato chipsthe film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows great plot twists as well as exciting action one thing you cant say about this film is that it is dull while its also far from subtle it is fun throughout though and well worth a lookhad i never seen vincent prices version of house of wax i probably would have liked the mad magician a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9 thats because while the mad magician is a wonderful film its highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it house of wax the bottom line is that since house of wax was so successful the formula was rehashed in the followup film both were made in 3d both have a plot where price has every justification to kill but he cant stop once hes committed the first and both are great fun to watch the biggest differences and there are few are that house of wax was in color and was more of a horror film and the mad magician was definitely more of a mysterymy advice is to see this film and house of wax the price version only they are both terrific 1950s horror films
448,2005 toronto film festival report it is official takashi miike is whackedthe annual midnight screening of the new takashi miike film the big spook war or the great yokai war or yôkai daisensô call it what you will this is a fanatical ridecolin geddes the fearless programmer stated this film was originally geared towards children in japan think of lord of the rings or neverending story for japan after the screening i can understand where they were going with that but damn this is takashi miike after all he directed the 01 film ichi the killer when it screening at the festival barf bags were handed out at the screening and no that wasnt just a marketing ployplot summary a young boy with a troubled home life becomes chosen and he stumbles into the middle of a great spirit war where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions through his journeythis is not really for kids well not too young certainly see them getting scared shitless with some of these spirits even the friendly ones on display this is unlike anything ive seen in the movie theater before a fantasy naturally some very funny but dark material you will not be bored can guarantee that will this ever hit north america doubtfulmy rating  b
449,lars von trier is never backward in trying out new techniques some of them are very original while others are best forgottenhe depicts postwar germany as a nightmarish train journey with so many cities lying in ruins leo kessler a young american of german descent feels obliged to help in their restoration it is not a simple task as he quickly finds outhis uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the zentropa railway line his job is to attend to the needs of the passengers when the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles a terrible argument ensues when a passengers shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished there are many allusions to the german fanaticism of adherence to such stupid detailsthe railway journey is like an allegory representing mans procession through life with all its trials and tribulations in one sequence leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with halfstarved bodies appearing to have just escaped from auschwitz  these images horrible as they are are fleeting as in a dream each with its own terrible impact yet unconnectedat a station called urmitz leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb in view of many bystanders he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage he returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock later he jumps from the train at high speed and lies in the cool grass on a river bank looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock if you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task quite ridiculous in fact it could only happen in a dreamits strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the traindespite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed i prefer lars von triers later films breaking the waves and the idiots the bomb scene described above really put me off perhaps im a realist
450,the luzhin defence is a movie worthy of anyones time it is a brooding intense film and kept my attention the entire time john turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender eccentric chess grandmaster and emily watson is spellbinding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected russian family the chemistry between watson and turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story all in all this movie is one of the best indepth looks at the life of a chess grandmaster and turturro and watson add a whole nonmainstream noncliche feel to the film most people will come out of the theater thinking and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories
451,interesting how much more realistic brosnans performance is to that of the original james bond novels when compared to the bond films hes neurotic paranoid an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot this is perfect break for him even so much as to make fun of the bond icon im a mess a parody of myself he says it doesnt get any better than that i just finished reading drno and this is very much how ian fleming had portrayed james bond personally i never liked brosnan as bond because he fit the icon too closely there was nothing for him to personalize the character with as compared to roger moore or sean connery its great to see brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall a shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with its an impressive portrayal and having greg kinear to ground him is just poetic this movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in my blue heaven but more genuine in their coping mechanisms
452,jeanjacques career began with his essay answer to a prize question civilization makes us evil this intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument in that sense it repeats a theme common to french films society is real identity is a construction freedom is criminal here the idea is treated literally both main characters find themselves and each other only when breaking rules this discovery may well hold true in france at any rate its quite romantic
453,like his earlier film in a glass cage agustí villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor this is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see the heightened drama intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical yet never steps into it in that way it pulls off an almost impossible feat to be so overthetop and yet so painfully restrained to be so charged and yet so understated and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye unabashed gorgeous and highly tense this film is simply superb
454,four teenage girls in a suburb of los angeles get into all kinds of trouble parties drugs cops mixedup parents older boyfriends jodie foster sort of the mother hen of the pack tries keeping everyone together like a family like the family unit shes never had and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she cant slowly everyone grows up and goes away that precise plot point though underscored throughout is unfortunately tampered with did we really need a long sequence with scott baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard or an even longer sequencealso with baiowhere foster has a strange soliloquy about the pain of illusion some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy and i didnt much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding but these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond and jodies face at the ending speaks volumes if viewers do get choked up at the end the movie has earned this it doesnt pander for tears or ask for sympathy it shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand  from 
455,this movie is well done on so many levels that i am in awe that the score is as low as it is 5910576 votes as of this writing this movie has incredible special effects a true epic storyline complex great character interaction and mindblowing battles  they have to be seen to be believed the only complaint i have is the subtitles on the hk dvd version i got some lines were not translated  i just dont understand when i read  hear from various sources it has a confusing plot i couldnt follow the story or characters came from nowhere from the very 1st time i watched this movie i understood it followed it knew why characters were there and i absolutely loved it ive watched it about 8 times already and each time it is pure enjoyment oh and this is not just my opinion because ive shown this movie to many fellow americans people who have never seen an hk film before who feel the same way not one of them failed to follow the storyline and each person declared their love for this movie oh man why cant we have stuff like this coming out of hollywood at least lord of the rings had a nice marriage of special effects character development and storylinethis is not coming from a asian film lover newbie either i own an extensive library of asian films and i must say that this movie is one of my greatest dvds when you watch it you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie you will be drawn into this fantasy world and you wont want to leave ive seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 both done by tsui hark and the 2001 is far better in comparison imobesides the subtitles i have one additional complaint about this movie i didnt want it to end im begging you mr hark  can we please have a sequel
456,huge ramones fan i do like the ramones and i suppose if you hate them then besides being a avid bush supporter you might not like this classicits immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80s infinitely better than the american pies that plague us nowthere are some other great high school films switchblade sisters fast times class of 84 three oclock high and the cheesy yet grippingdoesnt seem possible rivers edge but rnrhs will always be my favorite because its the funniest and most fun plus you can get up and dance with iti love you riff randell1010
457,i loved this movie when i saw it on febuary 3rd i knew i had to buy it it comes out to buy on july 24th it has cool deaths scenes hot girls great cast good story  good acting great slasher film the movies is about some serial killer killing off four girls see this movies
458,and all through the house is a special crypt episode not only because its from the first season but this episode was the first one i saw i remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in south carolina on hbo i saw this episode and i was buried to the crypt right then and forever i had always been a fan of horrorsuspense series and liked monster movies and with this series started by hbo i again had fearful pleasure this episode being the first one i saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites its just so enjoyable with a nice twist and all through the house has a nice cozy setting on a snowy christmas eve which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday chopping well anyway you have mary ellen trainorwho by the way plays in several warner brothers works usually small parts as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve the odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as santa escapes from a local nut house making for a late holiday chopping on christmas eve as from the old ec comic lessons you learn bad people get what they axe for well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured joan collins this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of alltime
459,i first see this film almost 21 years ago when it was an itv before the days of cable and satellite matinée i was off school with the mumps and i was totally wrapped in the film i have had it on bought video for about 10 years and i want to obtain a dvd copy of it david niven is my all time favourite actor and i think it is a travesty that he was over looked so many times when the oscars came around i also think that the queen should have knighted him as he easily did as much for the movie industry if not more than sean connery or anthony hopkins the way the film switches from black and white to colour and back again is well done and the film has such stellar actors as roger livesy marius goring and an early appearance from richard attenborough
460,fantastic movie one to excite all 5 senses is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information true hollywood conventions used like playing a list and very attractive actors as the heroes such as naomi watts julia cook  ned kellys lover heath ledger ned and orlando bloom joe byrne  neds right hand man and unattractive sorry geoffrey rush actors play the drunken and corrupt victorian police force this also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between ned ledger and julia cook watts to entice all the romantics females being especially susceptible even from the first scene when ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him sunshine and had a glint in his eye as he looked down at me his hand on me shoulder it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with ned kelly the underdog besides dont all aussies love an underdog
461,this movie was well done in all respects the acting is superb along with the fine audio soundtrack which i purchased because it was so moving it is my all time favorite movie ahead of eastwoods white hunterblack heart this movie is simply the bestcheers zuf
462,zentropa has much in common with the third man another noirlike film set among the rubble of postwar europe like ttm there is much inventive camera work there is an innocent american who gets emotionally involved with a woman he doesnt really understand and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the nativesbut id have to say that the third man has a more wellcrafted storyline zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect perhaps this is intentional it is presented as a dreamnightmare and making it too coherent would spoil the effect this movie is unrelentingly grimnoir in more than one sense one never sees the sun shine grim but intriguing and frightening
463,this is truly an excellent film with a revolutionary message both in form and content that should not be missed by any fan of french new wave or underground film there are barely opening or closing creditswe are just dropped into the world of consumerist art revolution and youth this film has little to do with documentary and is more interesting in playing with our ideas of advertising and its relationship to reality lines of real and not real are crossed in ways familiar with films discussing documentary but this time we do it for the sake of consuming and marketing not for describing the real
464,perhaps in an attempt to find another hot property for adaptation the brothers fleischer thought back to their highly successful foray into the world of the newspaper comic strip with their production of 1933s popeye the sailor fleischer studiosparamount although it was a part of the betty boop series miss b only made a brief appearance in the short leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible emergence of a full blown seriesas is now common knowledge the gruff squinty eyed brawlin seaman became perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever outlasting and literally outliving the fleischers and their studio lasting to this dayreturning to king features for another try at luck was no doubt the reason for trying out the very popular henry comic strip character in a betty boop outing objective being the seeking of another series the reasoning then surely seemed sound henry was a most popular feature in the hearst papers lineup appearing as both a daily and on sundays color comics supplement puck the comics weekly you know what fools these mortals be remember that one schultz in viewing the chubby little bald boy comic strip hero and his on screen antics both solo and in tandem with miss betty we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled the story and director dave fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic striplike situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little henry these mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page as the henry feature was mostly done in a sort of 4 color mimein the cartoon titled betty boop with henry the funniest living american fleischer studiosparamount pictures corporation 1935 we see what is basically being a one situational exercise being punctuated with the usual array of dave fleischers rapid fire machine gunlike gags in short henry spots a puppy in the window of betty boops pet shop it is a sort of love at first sight as henry attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had to coins in his pocket he is in formed by miss boop that it would be 200 in depression era money to make the purchase tears appear as the little guy leaves dejectedlybut a reprieve is soon on the horizon as betty asks the boy to mind the store while she leaves on urgent business in return for his services miss betty promises him the little dog in return of course they have a deal and betty leavesgetting to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock affords the opportunity for the fleischer crew to fire up a whole new string of gags this time featuring bird seed henrys bald pate and push brooms but not all at once of course schultz henrys enthusiasm for mass feeding of the stores avian population by first literally seeding his head soon leads to a mass defection of the birds out of the store to the open street in a mass jail breakbetty returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with henrys temporary custodial care all bets were off no doggie for henry he begins to leave dejectedly but soon convinces the proprietress to give him another shot at fixing things up his head covered with bird seed he manages to corral all of the little feathered creatures returning them to their pet store coop happily the little fella leaves but this time he has his own affectionate little face licking puppyundoubetly this was a winning combination we have the carefree energy filled free wheeling of the boy the kindness of betty and the emotions of the situation and doubtful outcome of the boy and his dog situation max and dave fleischer had given us a sort of almost minor minimasterpiece of a surreal comedy shortwe were quite surprised that no henry series followed judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character it certainly could have been sustained for some time at any rate this teaming was in many ways the best of the betty boop try out pictures although the first popeye the sailor fleischerparamount 1933 was the most successful and barely had any betty boop in it save for a cameo as a carnival hula dancer the henry short was much better than the two following king features tryouts betty boop and the little king and betty boop and little jimmy both 1936poodle schnitz

466,actually that video camera effect is just that its an effect a rather good one u dont know much about directing a film do you this film is in fact better than the original its great fun to watch made for tv doesnt need to follow any rules i find it hard to watch number 1 because of how he kills the first girl its disturbing and all the time we are routing for judd nelson to get away with it we as the viewers are on his side i hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake but i doubt it watching this film you can understand how real movies are made as this is sort of like a film within a film judd is one of the scariest villains ever and hes more realistic he doesnt just mindlessly chop people up like in other horrors
467,an old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later as he foretoldpeople are getting murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are scampering all over and naked bodies are being enjoyedkitty barbara bouchet is the suspect but we know she is not the killer is it franziska marina malfatti is it evelyn back from death for revenge is it a plot to steal an inheritance the color is superb in this thriller from emilio miraglia who only did one other giallo as far as i knowthe only thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several frames were cut out someone calls the police and suddenly they are there trying to save kitty
468,me being of irish origins loved this movie not only was the guy hot and funny he was also sincere and honest i loved the girl who he fell in love with too she was pretty they were such a cute couple the ending was so sad love this movie although it is a little dirty it reminds of a british or irish version of prime if you liked this movie you should watch prime same story line young guy falls for older women older women falls for young guy to a lot of paths cross in the end the best decision is made or task is completed dont have anything else to say without ruining the whole movie all though i thought the french guy was ugly less appealing to me ummif you like irish movies i would recommend circle of friends that movie is so good quick quote you might not get unless you watch it well thats my dinner ruined lol
469,a group of modelcaliber san francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre valentines day cards who is the killer and why is the killer after them my rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a filmsometimes slightly up sometimes slightly down however i cant remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for valentine the first time i watched it upon its theatrical release i thought it was pretty awfuli gave it a 4 out of 10 the equivalent of an f letter grade watching it for a second time last night i cant remember what the heck i didnt like about it i can only assume that maybe i was really in the wrong mood to watch it or maybe i just didnt get it in any event i loved it this time giving it a 9 out of 10 or an ait might sound ridiculous saying i didnt get a film like this but there is something to get valentine is almost a comedyhorror director jamie blanks who was also responsible for 1998s urban legend takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of scream 1996 and pushes most of the elements up a notch making valentine intentionally cheesycampy almost to the point of absurdity where absurdism is a positive stylistic term on top of that he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships the humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects most of the situations in the film and the modus operandi of the villain humorous or not are tied in to the valentines day thememany viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various clichérooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments however in light of the above the film is intentionally clichéd implausible and ludicrous its as if blanks is attempting and mostly succeeding to transcend the typical teen slasher by mockingspoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros thats the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on valentines day its an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre making it prime fodder for valentines extravagant lampooning scream had a similar aim with its horror material but the twist there was that the film was selfaware valentines day is intentionally not selfaware the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire lest some think im reading too much into the film its worthwhile to note that blanks said in interviews that he didnt want to just do another slasher film after urban legend and producer dylan sellers said he wanted to do something more adultother viewers may dislike the fact that valentines day differs so much from its putative source material the novel of the same name by tom savage the novels characters setting and plot are very different from the film sellers has said while it was a fine book i didnt think it was the right story for a film so instead the novel which is much dryer and more serious in tone was used as a launching pad a motif to create variations on for a horrorthriller story centered on valentines day while those facts wont help purists familiar with the book like the film its helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude its probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar themeblanks direction is impeccable visually valentines day has a lush look throughout with complex deep colors interesting sets and good staging blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark with clearly conveyed action he also directs his actors with aplomb catalyzing often slyly humorous performances david boreanaz as adam carr is involved in many of the funniest momentswhile valentines day is no masterpiece its a very good horrorthriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions if you watch it expecting something more tongueincheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more
470,i thought rachel york was fantastic as lucy i have seen her in kiss me kate and victorvictoria as well and in each of these performances she has developed very different and very real characterizations she is a chameleon who can play and sing anythingi am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachels performance in lucy even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesnt really look like lucy my response to that is so what i wasnt looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown and rachel certainly gave us that in great depth i also didnt want to see someone simply doing classic lucy routines therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits  vitameatavegamin and the candy factory it seems that some of the reviewers didnt realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits this approach i thought gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated  the professor and the grape stomping in particular there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachels mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having i couldnt believe she was able to capture that  and so naturallyi wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of i love lucy throughout the entire movie after all those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge given the right set of circumstances lucy didnt fit the mold of the old studio system in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate giftsi believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy drama wit sadness anger passion love ambition loyalty sexiness self absorption childishness and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing lucy was a star turn for rachel york i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future i also hope it brings her an emmy

472,this show has a few clichés and a few over the top dawsons creeklike moments a 16yearold talking about way back when life made sense but overall it seems like a decent show most of the characters seem very real and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot  ending with a good lesson in the end i just hope every episode doesnt turn out to be lifealtering like the first that would just be too much drama for this vehicle jeremy sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball i believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of
473,i came in in the middle of this film so i had no idea about any credits or even its title till i looked it up here where i see that it has received a mixed reception by your commentators im on the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught my attention as i watched the beautiful and sensitive score written in a coplandesque americana style my surprise was great when i discovered the score to have been written by none other than john williams himself true he has written sensitive and poignant scores such as schindlers list but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities as star wars but in my opinion what williams has written for this movie surpasses anything ive ever heard of his for tenderness sensitivity and beauty fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie and another recent score of his for catch me if you can shows still more wit and sophistication as to stanley and iris i like education movies like how green was my valley and konrack that one with john voigt and his young african american charges in south carolina and danny devitos renaissance man etc they tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening a story which cant be told often enough this one is an excellent addition to that genre
474,this movie brings back many memories of the classic cinema of old where actors didnt have to take their clothes off to make viewers watch their filmfirstly i think the main plus point of this movie is the amazing chemistry between shahid and amrita it is definitely the making of the filmi have seen lots of comments regarding the film being sickly sweet and overly slushy in response to this i think to a certain degree this is a correct analysis however considering this is a barjatya film i think that compared to mpk hahk hssh and mpkdh it has been toned down significantly hssh was almost unbearable to watch in some placesin this film however when the sentimental moments come along you find yourself smiling wishing the budding couple all the best and hoping that nothing bad happens to themanother major plus point is the performances of shahid and amrita both have acted very well especially shahid who looks great in the film amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major staralthough i really enjoyed the film as a whole i do feel that it was too long some of the middle could have been trimmed off and it would maybe made even more of an impact i also think the music although it fits into the film when you see the situations is slightly old fashioned and the movie could have benefited if a more uptodate soundtrack had been available although the picturisation of the songs mujhe haq hain and hamari shaadi mein are wonderfulall in all i definitely recommend this film its romantic looks stunning and has a dramatic climax i wont go into details just in case you havent seen itps if youre prone to cryingtake a tissue i needed several
475,there are many police dramas doing the rounds i am not sure why its probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evilthis film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of anne a raw recruit into a police squad stationed in the baltic area no attempt is made to glamorise the police they are truly down to earth harsh at times and unforgiving anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigationsthis is not a pleasant film not one to relax you there is not much feeling of optimism in it the police seem to be involved in a losing battle tomorrow there will be more bashings more murders more family breakups and more distressed children lets face it this is the world we live inas days go by anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating the only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character benny a 12 year old from a broken family anne has her own way of patching things up she turns a blind eye to bennys shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can i was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce bennys father it set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs after all the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving childrenwell cast but not my idea of an evenings entertainment
476,the word classic is thrown around too loosely nowadays but this movie well deserves the appelation the combination of neil simon walter matthau possibly the worlds best living comic actor and the late lamented george burns make for a comic masterpiece it is interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been like had not death prevented jack benny from playing george burns part as had been planned as it is the reunion scene in matthaus apartment is not likely to be surpassed as a sidesplitter definitely one of my desert island filmsenter
477,after 7 years of watching that dreadful nonsense called star trek voyager i was feeling pretty numb next gen and ds9 were bloody good stuff and voyager ruined tv trek this opened with probably the best pilot to a trek show the crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts scott bakula played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before the rest of the crew were really likable in their roles and i think they got off to a good first season when the show was prematurely canceled i was really disappointed in a mirror darkly showed us what the cast were capable of pity a film or tv movie was never considered so much back story and founding of the federation left to tell including the onset of hostilities with the klingons
478,i just saw valentine and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that ive seen in years unlike the recent trend of 90s horror flicks this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being selfmocking for those out there that hated scream there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here this is the perfect blend of 80s and 90s horror you get the style cinematography and good acting of 90s films and the stalkingslasher madness of an 80s flick i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for this is definitely a move in the right directiondenise richards stands out here as a fun character you can tell she liked her role and that makes her stand out i loved her in this movie
479,im from belgium and therefore my english writing is rather poor sorry for thatthis is one of those little known movies that plays only once on tv and than seems to vanishes into thin air i was browsing through my old vhs video collection and came across this title i looked it up and it had an imdb score of more than 710 thats pretty decenti must admit that its a very well put together movie and thats why im puzzled this is the only film made by this director how come he didnt make lots of films after this rather good one someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie ha ha  anyway i really would like to see that he pulls his act together and makes another good movie like this one please
480,wow so much fun probably a bit much for normal american kids and really its a stretch to call this a kids film this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits  very terry gilliam all the way through while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuelesquire moments the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kidhero with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miikes work the layers of meaning and metaphor particularly the antiwar  antirevenge message of human folly is pretty damn poignant as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films only instead of over the top torture and gore he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folklore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multifaceted adventure fn rad and one of miikes best

482,first of all this was not a three hour movie  two hours ten minutes last time i checked commercials arent actually part of a movie perhaps though it shouldve been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen because of this movie i do now but im not so sure thats a good thing everything here no one really needed to know this was essentially a movie that didnt need to be made but it was made and the reason is because lucy  desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars that is definitely so not true and very very sadanyway what was shown here in lucy was pretty good two complaints  the actress who played viv vance  not great casting at all and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york uhhh like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden shes a whole new person that wasnt too great but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy  desi no the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasnt necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said this focused mainly just on lucy  desi had there been more time had the story been more about lucys entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more but they werent so we got to see the likes of gable  lombard red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead wow that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool his presence and influence in lucys life really neat and its too bad that wasnt explored more oh well what was explored was done well for the most part honestly i dont think ill ever watch this again and i dont think this moviell be that memorable for someone who digs i love lucy but isnt an enormous lucille ball fan this should be an interesting watch my grade for this b
483,this is a very enjoyable film with excellent actors and actresses evoking a range of emotions it contains some really excellent humour which the whole family can enjoy you get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs and it ends very upbeat
484,this movie of 370 minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations told at list 500 years after those events toke place around 1100 bcthis is a 1969 movie so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian even the close caption is in italian pity many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie
485,a good film withfor its timean intense sprawling rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of john fords the searchers though not so brutal the story starts fast and doesnt let up with several scenes of really good dialog between stewarts jeff webster ronda castle and sheriff gannon this film is in some ways reminiscent of bend of the river 1952 also a mannstewart work but i found it far less sentimental and more interesting there are a few caveats a tooquickly wrapped up and rather sentimental ending 24yearold corrine calvert is not very convincing as a naive french teenager and of course the film takes place in the mythic west a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics dont apply but these are trivial concerns james stewart is surprisingly good as a dark disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself and the mountain scenery cant be beat a fine western costume drama
486,i think this movie is absolutely beautiful and im not referring only to the breathtaking scenery its about two unhappy english housewives who decide to rent an italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home lives in the end four women total rent the place together all with different personalities and different reasons for being there in this magically beautiful place they all find the peace theyre longing for and interestingly that peace comes from inward reflections and resolutions more so than without i also find it wonderful because of the relationships that are developed out kindness and understanding the acting is a joy to watch in itself i especially love the characters of lottie josie lawrence and lady caroline polly walker
487,this is a wonderful new crime series bringing together three old stalwarts of british television denis waterman james bolam and alun armstrong as retired detectives brought back to help clear up old cases under the leadership of younger careerfocused amanda redman the three quirky irritable old cops make a brilliant team applying twentyyear old detection methods in a police force which has moved a long way on since then  sometimes with effect at other times to the horror of their senior officers the three are portrayed sympathetically warts and all there are splendid comic scenes and some very moving ones as each of the three has to come to terms with growing old and the legacy of their pastsat the end of the first sixpart series we are promised a further series next year each of the characters had developed widower james bolam cannot come to terms with his wifes untimely death lothario denis waterman is learning to accept his role as grandfather and even obsessive alun armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past  and keep taking the medication while amanda redman has to face the alltoofamiliar conflict between having a life and a career the story lines have been interesting if rather heavily dependent on the wonders of dnatesting but it is the interplay of four of britains finest actors which has made the series unmissable
488,a matter of life and death what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film powell and pressburgers visual imagination knows no bounds every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions the switches between the bold colours of the real world to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is the final court scene is also fantastic as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter david nivens operation all of the performances are spot on roger livesey being a standout and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful never has there been a more romantic film than this if there has i havent seen it a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is and jack cardiffs cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone the way he lights kim hunters face makes her all the more beautiful what a genius he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting and the sound design is also impeccable the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its timethis is a true classic that can restore anyones faith in cinema under appreciated on its initial release and by todays audiences but one of my all time favourites which is why i give this film a 1010 in a word  beautiful
489,the summary line above spoken by james cloud robert preston to his brother tom robert sterling just about says it all jim aka kid wichita has a way of making things happen only trouble is he usually leaves dead bodies where hes been not the sort of mentoring tom envisions for younger brother jeff who likes what he sees in jim especially when defending their ranch against local texas cattlementhe opening credits state introducing john barrymore jr as the younger brother in this his very first screen appearance that seemed rather odd to me particularly since he was addressed as jeff almost immediately into the story approximately eighteen at the time of this movie he bears a passing resemblance to sean penn no stranger to personal and legal problems throughout his career as well as estrangement from his family i was left wondering if his daughter drew barrymore might have ever seen this picture im inclined to think noton the subject of resemblances i was also struck by the thought that the young robert sterling looked a bit like roy rogers early in his career knowing sterling previously only from his role as george kerby in the early 1950s tv series topper i thought he looked out of place in a western but that might just be me his character becomes emboldened by his brothers resourcefulness at creating trouble and provides some of the edginess to this not so typical story minor subplots abound including the relationship rancher john gall john litel has with his son the sheriff who kid wichita kills and the troubled marriage between kathleen boyce cathy downs and her husband earl who kid wichita kills chill wills rounds out the main cast as one of tom clouds hired hands and figures in the somewhat predictable finalewhats not quite predictable is how things eventually wind up there and for that reason this western earns points for following a less traveled hence not quite as formulaic a plot as a lot of good brotherbad brother westerns do combined with the eclectic casting of the principals its one id recommend even if you have to endure some of the jump cuts and sloppy editing that i experienced with my copy
490,this is one of my alltime favorite films and while it may move too slowly for some its well worth seeing a corporate lawyer richard chamberlain is dragged into a case involving city aborigines and this is no ordinary case ok a man has died but it wasnt exactly a normal killing there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic  oppressive the aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans this has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about city vs tribal aborigines and of course no abo in the big city would practice tribal ways uh huh chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to whats happening although no matter how many times ive seen this i cant quite grasp the exact connection this is a very eerie and creepy film and is a fine example of peter weirs ability to create tension out of nothing the ending is a little ambiguous but i take it literally its the easiest way out and the scariest 10 out of 10 and highly recommended
491,steven speilbergs adaptation of alice walkers popular novel is not without its share of controversy when first released members of the black community criticised its treatment of black men while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black womenthis is the story of a young black woman named celie growing up in rural america after the turn of the century she has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sistercelie played in later years by newcomer whoopie goldberg is married off to an abusive husband danny glover the husband is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from celies lifethe story is often heartbreaking as celie keeps up hope that she may one day be reunited with her sister and with her children throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters including sophia a tough as nails wife to her step son and shug a loud and luscious saloon singer who teaches her a thing or two about lovespeilbergs direction is all over this picture which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances i dare you to watch this film and not be moved the film the color purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story while it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the african story both of which were so vivid in the book the movie remains true to its themes allowing the voice of alice walker to shine throughi couldnt begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film suffice it to say however this is one of the few films that i can watch again and again and which has left an indelible mark on me
492,what can i say i have grown up watching hum saath saath hain hum aapke hain koun and maine pyar kiya soraj have always been different movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times soraj creates something thats hard to find love and joint family that loving and great vivah is journey for a couple that are getting arrange marriage that turns on arrange and love marriage shahid has done fine work anupamji as always brilliant amrita rao quit different even though i felt that someway the other to me she doesnt suit in that role weve seen her in ishk vishk and ab ke baras and main ho on na so quit different role that she isnt in to she is been excellent in main ho on na and ishk vishk but may be she couldve put little more in the role anyways great going work by barjatya this movie rejuvenates the values that we forgot sweet film of the year great music and lyrics i am not sure if its a remake but anyways brilliant story that is original sorajs movies have been brilliant all the way so we always expect something different from him great work by all the cast the crew and everybody lovely family film to enjoy with your parents siblings friends and love ones i give it 10 out of 10
493,everyone is surely familiar with this most famous of stories  a heartless businessman is visited by the ghost of his dead partner on christmas eve and warned that if he continues in his uncaring ways then he will be doomed to an afterlife in chains so that he can avoid his partners fate he is visited by three spirits who show him visions of christmases past present and yet to come so that he will hopefully see the error of his ways before it is too late a rather morbid tale one might think but it is classic charles dickens and also one of the most famous and popular christmas stories of all timeto me this is the definitive version of dickens timeless story its the one i always remember watching in school and i remember being absolutely terrified by it the ghost of jacob marley the final scene with the ghost of christmas present under the bridge and the ghost of christmas yettocome especially i found very frightening how on earth did the film gain the u certificate for nonuk readers u is the lowest classification it means family friendly and children welcome nothing to scare them etc this is certainly not the case though as some smaller children will undoubtedly find the final segment positively terrifying with the grim reaperlike spectre of christmas futurebe that as it may from the many versions of this classic story i have seen adapted for film this is possibly the most faithful to the book most notably included is a segment rarely seen in film adaptations of the original text  that of the ghost of christmas present showing scrooge the two children hidden under his robe youd never get away with a scene like that nowadays the two children represent ignorance and need although changed to want in this filmcriticisms for me however become apparent having watched it again with more objective and trained eyes the main one of which being that george c scotts portrayal of scrooge seems simply not cold enough he laughs too much i dont want to use the word jolly because of course ebeneezer is anything but but he does seem to be merely a grumpy old man rather than the positively unkind cold and uncaring man that he is in the book and other films patrick stewart portrayed him excellently in one of the most recent versions filmed and michael caine despite acting alongside the muppets was positively cold further the development of the character over the course of the film as he learns more about the error of his ways and grows towards redemption is unconvincing and appears inconsistent he appears to have changed little by the time he reaches the third spirits final lessonbut ignoring this one albeit major quibble it is still a spellbinding and ultimately heartwarming christmas tale as all christmas films should be london of course looks like the perfect picturesque quaint snowcovered english town that many americans probably imagine it still is the truth is that even then that london was grey and grimy  and any snow would never have been so white and everyone is so impeccably dressed too even the poor people look rather dapper but of course its a christmas film so why shouldnt everything look nice perfect holiday season viewing coupled with copies of its a wonderful life miracle on 34th street and the snowman and youve got everything you need
494,this is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind tsui hark it is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to steven chows shaolin soccer from the moment the movie startedthere was astronishing backdrops at every edge which weredeplicted with superb style if you are a science fiction or chinese martial arts geek youll love the excessive amounts of many 3d effects and realistic computer generated weapons there comes a fine performanceas always from ekin cheung who plays sky king he teams up with louis koored who i was very impressed by his flexible wing which deflected incoming attacks the fighting movements of these actors were proficient in every way not only is the action superb but the has a somewhat complex storyline many criticisers of this movie complain of the lack of storytheme or just shoved in random bits of debrise and even describe as the legend of poo however the viewer cannot rely on watching dragon ballz and other similar manga cartoons to understand this movie others who are famarialy with wu xia movies will have a better appoach in due respect there can be one weakness that could be foreseen the blow that was deliveried to the enemy at the very last fight scene could of been more substantially and devastiingly madein spite of all this its a must see
495,an insomniacs nightmare was an incredibly interesting wellmade film i loved the way it just throws you into the main characters subconscious without coddling the viewerthe acting was top notch  honestly i would watch dominic monaghan read the phone book  but everyone else especially the young girl was great as well i was very impressed by the look of the film too usually independent films have a grainy ishotthisonmycamcorder look to them but this director knows what shes doing the lighting the cinematographyquality work im looking forward to a featurelength work from tess nanavati
496,richard chamberlain is david burton a tax lawyer living in sydney australia who is drawn into a murder trial defending five aboriginal men accused of murdering a fellow native in peter weirs apocalyptic 1977 thriller the last wave taking up where picnic at hanging rock left off the film goes deeper into exploring the unknown and in the process shows the gulf between two cultures who live side by side but lack understanding of each others culture and traditions weir shows how white society considers the native beliefs to be primitive superstitions and believes that since they are living in the cities and have been domesticated their tribal laws and culture no longer apply from the start burton is drawn deeper and deeper into a strange web of visions and symbols where the line between real time and dream time evaporates water plays an important symbolic role in the film from the opening sequence in which a sudden thunder and hailstorm interrupts a peaceful school recess to burtons discovery that his bathtub is overflowing and water is pouring down his steps as violent and unusual weather continue with episodes of black rain and mud falling from the sky the contrast between the facile scientific explanations of the phenomenon and the intuitive understanding of the natives is made clear burton and his wife annie olivia hamnet study books about the aborigines and learn about the role of dreams in the tribal traditions when he invites one of his clients chris lee david gulpilil to his home for dinner he is disturbed to find that he is the subject of an inquiry by chris and his friend charlie nadjiwarra amagula an enigmatic aborigine sorcerer involved with the defendants as burtons investigation continues his clients make his work difficult by refusing to disclose the true events surrounding the murderafter chris starts to appear in his dreams burton is convinced that the aborigine was killed in a tribal ritual because he saw too much though chris refuses to acknowledge this in court burton becoming more and more troubled by a mystery he cannot unravel says to his stepfather priest why didnt you tell me there were mysteries this is a legitimate question but according to the reverend the church answers all mysteries burton knows now that he must discover the truth for himself and enters the tribal underground caves though we do not know for certain what is real and what is a dream he comes face to face with his deepest fears in a haunting climax that will leave you pondering its meaning into the wee hours of the morningin this period of history in which native hopi and mayan prophecies predict the end of history and the purification of man leading to the fifth world the last wave though 25 years old is still timely the aborigines are portrayed as a vibrant culture not one completely subjugated by the white man yet i am troubled by the gnawing feeling that we are looking in but not quite seeing weir has opened our eyes to the mystery that lies beyond our consensual view of reality but he perpetuates the doomorientation that sees possibility only in terms of fear showing nature as a dark and uncontrollable power without a hint of the spiritual beauty that lives on both sides of time
497,this is a lovely spiritrestoring movie from the use of the actual villa that inspired elizabeth arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting every choice was perfectly right the quiet joy of this film doesnt stale after repeated viewings josie lawrence miranda richardson polly walker and joan plowright seem to have been born to play these parts i would dearly love to see enchanted april released on dvd in a widescreen format
498,this is one of the best hong kong action films around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great fight scenes this sammo film has it all romance drama excitement and a great hero as well it is the only martial arts film that got me interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights sammo fans this is a must see see also eastern condors shanghai express yuen biao is ace dragons forever and enter the fat dragon
499,just finished watching this movie for maybe the 7th or 8th time picked it up one night previously viewed at blockbuster and absolutely loved it ive shown it to 4 people so far and they have enjoyed it as well avoid of all the hollywood glamour special effects and stress on the shock factor this independent film by paul f ryan hits the nail on the head in dealing with the after affects of traumatic situations taking place after a high school shooting two characters alicia busy philipps and deanna erika christensen form an unlikely bond alicia the girl with the stone heart the goth who has a pessimistic attitude to life assists deanna to overcome the issues of life and death and living in the aftermath meanwhile deanna attempts to help alicia to see some of the softness and light in the world again not stressing on the shocking event of the shooting but on the interpersonal relationships amongst those who survived it sets this movie apart despite its lowbudget and short filming time this movie is far from cheesy ryan pays respect to a situation he has never endured and attempts to delve into the human psyche with an amazing up and coming actress philipps adds the necessary dramatics to the dialogue and overall feel for the film and christensen helps to balance out the doom and gloom feeling this movie may have overall i recommend this movie and if you enjoy the topic of school aggression and violence and learning more about it i also suggest the documentary its a girls world put out by cbc in 2004 which deals with the topic of social bullying comparing and contrasting two groups of girls one in montreal quebec and the other in victoria british columbia the group of friends and acquaintances of dawn marie wellesley a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally bullied
500,sammo hungs 1989 film pedicab driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece i have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any hong kong film ever has it is a combination of pretty good and well written drama interesting and sympathetic and also nonsympathetic characters some genuinely funny humor and truly overthetop hyper kung fu that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with hong kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industrysammo and max mok siu chung play two pedicab drivers who live in hong kong in the middle part of the last century i think they drive their cabs and are also desperate for love sammo is interested in local baker girl ping nina li chi while max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful fennie yuen kitying he falls madly in love with many other characters get introduced too and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so i cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in hong kong soon we get to know for instance that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists too and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created as well as some nice dramathe film has a great cast the leads are all very good and restrained not as painfully awful overacting and humor as in sammos otherwise great eastern condors 1987 for example and they are also thanks to the carefully written screenplay pretty likable and easy to identify with the cast includes many familiar hk cinema faces and directors in small roles like corey yuen kwai the legendary action director and director of films like saviour of the soul 1 and 2 ninja in the dragons den and fong sai yuk 1 and 2 the masterful composer lowell lo koonting john woos the killer and ringo lams school on fire and prison on fire among many others pedicab driver included the shaw veteran liu chia liang whom with sammo has a furious fight with sticks alfred cheung kinting the director of dark hk noir classic on the run from 1988 the late great lam ching ying best known for his friendly face in various hk vampire horrorkung fucomedies to name just a few in fact the cast in pedicab driver is one of the most interesting ive seen in any other hk productionthe film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between max mok and fennie yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to lowell los character they really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love no matter whats your past or what youve done for living get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle actioner also the other characters efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship and of course love still i think what fennie says to max about the future bad cooking is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively unfortunatelybut then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in which is the action the outrageous and overthetop action the fight scenes include traditional kung fu some sticks meat cleavers and the like and theyre used here as hysterically as in the most mind blowing kung fu scene ive seen in any film ever jackie chans drunken master ii 1994 they really are that great there are wires and theyre used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked or punched simply amazing and again something only hong kong cinema can deliver also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold hisher breath as the film has one fast car vs pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination still the film makers seem not to accept the violence of the film as sammo is like the late bruce lee willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa and i think this kind of morale no matter how obvious or shallow it may be is a good thing even in a harmless film like this as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainmentthe film has also some very witty bits of humor that im not sure everyone in hollywood or america for example would understand or like at all the hilarious star wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when i realized what i was seeing also some funny scenes are created out of sammos passion for ping still the greatest amazementfilled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply insane and so breathtaking i just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these eastern film makers when i witness something like this and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction of coursepedicab driver is among the most incredible hong kong action films that i have ever seen and easily among sammos greatest achievements if the few minor flaws were not there this could rate even brighter and higher 810
501,when i first saw this movie i was with my dad he encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites after watching the movie it instantly became one of my favorites a river runs through it is about two brothers who each take a different path in life norman maclean craig sheffer is the older of the two brothers and he is set on the path of education paul maclean brad pitt is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles the movie follows these characters as the each follow their own paththere is no downside to this movie you will be entertained the whole way through the acting directing and script is all perfect the two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score both of which entrap you in the world robert redford creates for you this is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic it sure is in my book if you havent seen this movie definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever
502,i think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second as someone else wrote in a comment the implications of this kind of relationships incest and lesbianism in the romanian societyso to begin with the second aspect to make it short it wasnt visible at allas for the first as i said it had much more potential i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension much more tension and the potential tension didnt get throughi think the soundtrack couldve been more than those few songs on the background and the theme wich was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments yeah i could feel the absence of a better soundtrackthe actors i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 810 not enough sensuality in the key momentsa total of 710 mostly for the story
503,edmund burke said that all evil needs is for good me to do nothing hollywood often gives us trash because not enough families go to see quality films this movie was uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith it had no violence no lewdness and did not deserve a pg rating the western scenery was filmed well and some of the vistas were simply breathtaking actors were a bit young for their parts but otherwise believable and talented music score was too loud and in some places drowned out the dialog completely im seldom surprised by movie endings any more but i was pleasantly surprised by this one sometimes the good guys do win and they win by honest efforts we liked the movie and the message and would recommend it for the entire family
504,with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene the movie plays much like a dream and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices the film works isnt trying to work as history but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever and there is a wild imagination in its style i can completely understand why people would hate it but i give it 910
505,futz is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in new york in the 1960s the origins of off off broadway though its not for everyone it is a genuinely brilliant darkly funny even more often deeply disturbing tale about love sex personal liberty and revenge a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our constitution the story is not about being gay though  its about love and sex that dont conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate on the surface it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig but like any great fable its not really about animals its about something bigger  stifling conformity in americathe stage version won international acclaim in its original production it toured the us and europe and with others of its kind influenced almost all theatre that came after it luckily we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived with the original cast and original director tom ohorgan who also directed hair and jesus christ superstar on broadwaythis is not a mainstream easytotake studio film  this is an aggressive unsettling glorious deeply emotional wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that youll never forget and it just might change the way you see the world
506,spielbergs first dramatic film is no letdown its a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an africanamerican woman it also proves that not all movies that have the africanamerican ethnicity as the center of the story have to be helmed by an africanamerican directorwhat i love about this movie is spielbergs ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book furthermore danny glover was excellent as mr and usually hes just himself throughout most of his movies but in this he completely branches out and is someone else for once but the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from whoopi goldberg she is excellent as celie you will never forget these characters once youve seen this movienow i heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well and all i can say is i hope its about as good as this one is because this one is a film that shouldnt be missed
507,one of the best ensemble acted films ive ever seen there isnt much to the plot but the acting incredible you see the characters change ever so subtly undr the influence of the rented villa in italy and love and happiness the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you much as the villa does on all the women truly enchanted
508,when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay speaking of gameplay the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you
509,a very good start i was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced it should have been cruder to match we saw in the original series the cast is interesting although the vulkan lady comes across as a little too human she needs to school on spock who after all is the model for this race too bad they couldnt have picked jeri ryan i like ms park the koreanlady the doctor has possibilities havent sorted out the other males except for the black guy hes a really likeable bakula needs to find his nichein ql his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything he is of course big and strong enough for the heroics the heavies were ok although i didnt like their makeup
510,back in the day if marion davies had had her druthers and didnt just listen to william randolph hearst shed have done more films like show people and been a lot happier in fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy shed have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like when knighthood was in flower and janice meredith what youre seeing by all accounts in show people is the real davies a gifted comedienne a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person she could really identify with the character of peggy pepper aka patricia prepoire she put up with her share of pretense in her hollywood stardomif the plot of show people was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a backstage story i guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in hollywood like so many others looking for that big break she wants to drama but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics she gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face but learns her trade and also wins the heart of young comic actor william hainesshe does get her first big break but it doesnt come for haines as well and marion does get to do legitimate drama with actor paul ralli playing andre telfair a pretend no account count of avignon somebody here was taking a shot at actor lou tellegen lover and husband of sarah bernhardt and geraldine farrar and others and to hear tell of it one of the most despised people in cinemashow people was one of the first films to have the unbilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves you will get to see folks like charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart mae murray john gilbert eleanor boardman etc just being themselves in and around the film colony that in itself makes show people a film worth savingshow people also made good use of standard tin pan alley songs like aint we got fun im sitting on top of the world youd be surprised california here i come as the film came out on the cusp of sound being introduced a song called crossroads was introduced in it its not a bad number but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack i guess since theyre not seen it was felt no billing was necessary still id like to know and im sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see show peopleits easy to see why marion davies liked this film so much and considered it a personal favorite she looks so at home in this film and her real life lack of pretense shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience

514,this is the kind of movie england can do in its sleep and thats meaning it as a compliment because of the success of very british comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the twentieth century most notably adaptations of e m forster novels this very merchantivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992 it was an exceptional year for actress miranda richardson having appeared as the wife of jeremy irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in damage and as the ira terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in the crying game here she plays a quiet serene type of woman in rose arbuthnot one who with josie lawrence who plays lottie wilkins embarks on a trip that is filled with selfdiscovery they are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies one caroline dester played by the enigmatic polly walker who resembles a very vamp louise brooks and not just in the style of hair she wears and mrs fisher joan plowright this foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it but this is fine its the movie it wants to be alfred molina and jim broadbent then relatively new to american audiences fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters and all in all mike newell makes with his movie a living thing of nearmagical elements full of quiet moments and wonder

518,the best film on the battle of san antonio texas in march 1836 was john waynes 1960 epic the alamo in a one shot job as director producer that temporarily financially strapped him wayne demonstrated that he was talented in movie making outside of his iconlike acting ability personifying the westi have commented on that film in a review the other night and i pointed out that wayne and james edward grant the screenwriter tackled some points that were barely mentioned in earlier films about the battle they did bring in the issue of slavery they also finally discussed the contribution of local mexican land owner juan seguin as an important leader in the war for independence on par with crockett bowie travis austin and houston but there was one weakness though well hidden in the film wayne worked hard to cast it properly thinking of many people for lead roles in it but he did not properly handle the leader of the enemy forces general antonio de santa anna the role was played by an obscure actor ruben padilla on this board his thread shows only three credits listed padilla did not have any spoken dialog even in spanish and while he does have one of the last shots in the film he just is shown as a silent tyrant observing the burning of the bodies of the americans and their alliesdespite several poor choices in the casting of this television movie the alamo thirteen days to clory it is the best film in showing the man who was from 1836 to 1854 a leading bogeyman to american policy makers raul julia was a wonderful stage actor i was fortunate to see him in a production in the late 1980s of arms and the man in manhattan as sergius he was never boring and usually first rate in his actinghere we see the egotistical monster at his worst nothing is acceptable that does not fit santa annas wishes or activities it can be the failure of an orderly in the army to bring some item he requested fast enough or it can be the temerity of these foreign brigands as he saw the americans in not knuckling down to himself the napoleon of the westsanta anna was president of mexico five or six times between 1830 and 1855 he claimed that he first got involved in overthrowing a president because that president did not live up to the countrys constitution but it was the power that kept him going year after year it is a sad commentary that he was the leading mexican historical figure in those two decades no political figure or military figure would rise to override him until benito juarez did in the late 1850s initially he claimed great liberal ideals but he once admitted that the people of mexico were children who needed guidance for one hundred years before they could rule themselves and thus he sounds like gilbert roland in crisis talking about the people he has helped lead against jose ferrer the amazing thing about him was he managed to keep coming back his policies were disasters while we know about his attack on texas to put down a revolt there he also tried to expand into guatamala and probably saw himself controlling much of central america he did win at the alamo but at great cost of lives his massacre of col fannins men at goliad was inexcusable one might make a case for the destruction of the defenders of the alamo who were fighting to the last but fannin had surrendered then came the disaster of san jacinto where his army was wiped out he failed to take adequate precautions to watch for the american troops he was captured and humiliated and forced to sign a surrender of texas houston was kind to him the troops wanted to string him upexcept for losing a leg in a battle against the french in 1838 he managed not to get wounded in most of his wars he repudiated the forced surrender of texas but could not militarily undue it instead he would lead mexico into defeat in the war of 1846  48 against the americans leading to the mexican session the us was decent enough to pay mexico 15000000 for the southwest but mexico lost half of its territory he would be president for the last time in 1853 in time to give franklin pierces horrendously bad administration its one moment of glory  santa anna sold the border of arizona and new mexico the gadsden purchase to the us no other mexican president not even porfirio diaz ever cost his country so much diaz did sell out to foreign business interests but he built up mexicos economic muscles doing so he was exiled in 1855 and settled in staten island there he managed to do his most creative work he introduced chicle to the us and it became chewing gum some achievement julias santa anna is younger than the practiced cynic and schemer who became americas best land purchase agent he is not going to stand for opposition and he jumps into furious tantrums at a moments notice most of the time his chief aide col black david ogden stiers here a british born officer holds his tongue  he does not wish to be in front of a firing squad as he could be but stiers is secretly less than enchanted by his boss at the end when alone with the newly widowed wives of the dead alamo defenders stiers suggests that they tell the world what santa anna is really like and they did
519,the first was good and original i was a not bad horrorcomedy movie so i heard a second one was made and i had to watch itwhat really makes this movie work is judd nelsons character and the sometimes clever script a pretty good script for a person who wrote the final destination films and the direction was okay sometimes theres scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainylookgreat madefortv movie it was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch judd nelsons stanley doing what he does besti suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel just so youll have an idea what stanley is like and get a little history background
520,pierce brosnan has sipped his last martini and returns in an outrageous selfparody as the aging foulmouthed boozy assassin julian noble who has a particular fondness for teenage girls bullfights and tacky clothes during a job in mexico city he meets danny greg kinnear a straightfaced denver suburban businessman whos in town to make his deal ofalifetime in a hotel bar despite their completely different personalities and julians crude and insensible remarks they become friends largely carried by the performances of pierce brosnan and greg kinnear director richard shepard revealed that he didnt write the film with pierce brosnan in mind  but i can hardly imagine this without him he proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just james bond or coldwar spies the scene in which the two meet at a glossy hotel bar stunning sets and beautifully photographed really is a bravura piece of acting skills the scene lasts almost fifteen minutes and although it was probably carefully scripted the two actors are largely improvising but they succeed wonderfully it almost feels like a new standard in screen acting think of robert de niro and harvey keitel in mean steets improvising and add one of the most subtle underpinnings of many genre clichés and the actors own typecasting brosnans james bond in particular and you got one of the most delightful pairings in recent hollywood sadly the story wears thin after a while after an hour the film just runs out of steam nevertheless and i cant put my finger on it exactly i did enjoy this very much it just feels very fresh and original with some imaginative use of sets and lighting and some hints to seijun suzuki and jeanpierre melville the other characters arent given much to do but this film does offer something new in that respect it almost effortlessly succeeds in blending all conventional genres into quite an entertaining spoof very amusingcamera obscura  710
521,marlene gorris has established herself as one of the worlds great directors this sensitive visually beautiful film is based on a story by vladimir nabokov and captures well that writers dark irony john turturro gives what i consider to be his finest performance i am usually not a fan of his and emily watson is brilliant as well well worth seeing
522,its very simple to qualify that movie a pure masterpiece this opinion is formulated for the following reasons the performance of the actors they seem to be citizens of that epoch 1100 bc they personalize perfectly the characters a second reason is that the poetry expressed by homere in his poem is well given by the production among others the narrations made by the chorus give a particular atmosphere that makes us party of the artistic rendition third reason the reconstitution of the decor is absolutely perfect in mediterranean regions where the action of the poem occurred and most of all the emotion is on the rendezvous i repeat my appreciation a pure masterpiece
523,a funny comedy from beginning to end there are several hilarious scenes but its also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me creative story line with a very talented cast i thoroughly enjoyed it
524,i never saw it on tv but rented the dvd through netflix as soon as i found that it was available i had high expectations and was not disappointed its funny and the animation is excellent that level of quality i would only have expected from feature films so im surprised at some of the bad comments on it maybe the dvd release had improved animation one bonus to the dvd is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot im an adult and i really appreciate that it is for adults it isnt only kids who like cute animated characters it is nowhere near raunchy as some have claimed but i can see where some parents wouldnt want their young children to see it im very disappointed that it was cancelled i wish they would produce more episodes or perhaps a movie
525,this firstrate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement romance and james stewart to the screen the far country is the only one out of all five stewartmann westerns that is often overlooked stewart yet again puts a new look on the everpresent personalities he had in the five stewartmann westerns jeff webster stewart is uncaring always looking out for himself which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him ironically he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without this displays that he might just care for one person his sidekick ben tatum played by walter brennan since tatum is the one that gave it to him mann yet again puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five stewartmann westerns he displays violence excitement plot twists romance and corruption the story is that jeff and ben through a series of events wind up in the get rich quick town of dawson along with gold partners calvet and flippen and nogood but beautiful roman and her hired men they are unable to leave because crooked sheriff mr gannon mcintire and his deputies will hang them since the only way out is through skagway which is gannons town but eventually mcintire comes to them but not to collect stewart andor his fine that he supposedly owes to the government what is mcintire there for he is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money people are killed a sheriff for dawson is considered needed and calvet elects stewart because he is good with a gun stewart however refuses the job because he plans to get all the gold he can and then pull out he also refuses it because he does not like to help people since law and order always gets somebody killed so flippen is elected instead a miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of gannons men a purely evil mustachioed fancy gunman named madden who carries two guns played by wilke flippen attempts to arrest madden and see that justice be done but he cannot stand up to him so he becomes the town drunk a man named yukon replaces flippen stewart and tatum start to pull out but are ambushed by gannons men tatum is killed and stewart is wounded stewart finally realizes that he must do something or gannon will take over dawson set up his own rules and it will become his town just like skagway the audience also realizes what stewart must do another thing that the audience realizes is that stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and gannon if stewart leaves gannon would take over the town if stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly this is where a great scene occurs stewart walks into his cabin he has a sling on his arm for a few seconds his gun in the gunbelt is hanging on a post beside his bed the gun is close up stewart is in the background just inside the door he stares at it for a few seconds he tosses the sling away the sling lands on the back of a chair and falls to the floor this is symbolic because he is throwing away his old life which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself he comes into his new life of helping people when they need help what ends the film is a gunsblazing furious show of good against evil and a genuinely feelgood feeling that everything will be alright
526,ive always knew anne desalvo was a great character actor now i know she is a great writerdirector also i have been a fan since i first saw her in the movies perfect my favorite year dc cab and stardust memoriesits so rare to see lee grant these days in anything she has been missing from the screen for far too long its also wonderful to see cloris leachman in something other than a sitcom this is her best work since the last picture show if you grew up in an italian american family you will love this movie i wasnt expecting a lot when i started watching this movie so i was pleasantly surprised when i fell in love with this movie if you get the chance watch it
527,call me stupid but i absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie valentine it was so wellmade wellwritten wellacted welldirected etc everything about it was wonderful there were parts that were relatively routine lilys death very funny wwwbleedmedrycom completely horrifying and creepy paiges death and just plain heartbreaking the first scene i think the entire cast did a great job especially the three leads david boreanaz denise richards both of whom i met and got autographs from during the filming of this movie  very nice people and marley sheltoni am very sick of people calling this movie another scream clone this movie is in no way a scream clone in fact this film runs rings around scream it actually makes sense scream was also not the only movie to feature a masked killer in it excuse me but it looks like scream was also a clone too ahem friday the 13th halloween and many other scary movies also featured masked killers i also think that the novelty of the cupidmasked killer is brilliant its so strange to see a sweet cupid face doing all of these horrible things another novelty the nose bleeding makes way for a fantastic ending the ending gives me chills every time i see it so even if you didnt like it the first time watch valentine again and give it another chanceps keep an eye out for my new website wwwlovehurtsorg coming soon
528,also known as stairway to heaven in the us during wwii british peter carters david niven plane is shot down in combat but he survives he meets and falls in love with lovely june kim hunter but it seems a mistake was made in heavenhe should have died a french spirit comes to get him but he refuses he is soon to plead his case in front of a heavenly tribunal that he should be allowed to livesounds ridiculous but this is actually an incredible film the script is good with the actors playing the roles completely straightfaced and its beautifully directedthe scenes on earth are in breathtaking technicolor ive never seen such beautiful blue skies and the scenes in heaven are in black and white niven is a little stiff at times but hunter is just great and very beautiful and roger livesey is superb as a doctor trying to help niven the imagery throughout is amazing especially the staircase and during the final trial sequence and the special effects are truly great considering the age of the film theres also a very strange sequence when niven runs into a totally nude young boy herding sheep this is an absolutely beautiful thought provoking filmhighly recommended this remains unknown in the us which is a shame
529,i have seen the trailer for this movie several times over and i have to say that ned kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film when i saw the trailer for the first time i could not take my eyes away from it it got my attention for sure heath ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him period pieces not to mention orlando bloom who is seen for a split second looks fantastic i think that this movie will be a hit and will be seen over and over again my many people
530,i think it is a nice movie i think it is a very romanian movie through scenery and atmoshpere i think it was not intended to be sensual sensuality is a result not a purpose i think it is very natural i think it is humane i think it was interesting i think the actors never made me think waw lame acting they are not sean connory  co neither is the film a block buster they are like the movie normal ppl that can act i think the movie reached its intention i think it made me feel things or feel them again   i think im not objectivei really enjoyed it that i know
531,this movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional indian values which are being replaced by western onesits a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative aroundshahid kapoor gives a gr88 performance as a desi about to tie knot with amrita rao who is also very desi and she also acts pretty wellthe genre of the movie is the same as hahk and such movies deserve to be made in india for the revival of old traditional valuesthe movies doesnt get 10 as it isnt very good at music which counts a lot in every moviebesides this it is flawless
532,wow 5 more hours of riget lars continues the great combination of occult dark horror and soapopera drama picking up exactly where the last episode of the previous series left offcomplete with the same high intensity and suspense though that doesnt last for better or worse this installation in the franchise seems somewhat more bent on haste in the last series there seemed to pass a day or a week between each episode whereas in this it clearly is one long stretch where one episode ends the next begins a lot can be said about lars von trier but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric both qualities show in this the plot continues its excellence now giving a few regular characters that were minor players in the previous four episodes more attention basically every character from the first returns at least as far as the main roles go the pacing isnt as sharp as in the first part and i found myself less gripped by this one that is not in any kind of way to say that this didnt involve me though i still found myself constantly watching and at several points reacting strongly often out loud to what was going onextremely unusual behavior for me as i am an incredibly silent person as i also was during the first like the first this also brings up some loaded ethical questions building on the foundation from the first this brings the story further and being a sequel the scope is also bigger grander more spirits more bizarre occurrences more subplots the strong graphic material of the first also returns and its been kicked up a notch the characters are developed further the acting is amazing as that of the first udo kier solidifies his immense talent to anyone who doubted it playing a very difficult characteranyone who has seen the first series can most likely figure out what i mean and acting in a language he didnt speakhe was later dubbed and still handing in such a strong performance the cinematography remains great and is still very handheld with rapid zooms and the occasional long take the editing is sharp with a few direct cuts in soundthough these were more prominent in the first now with all that said i would really like to be able to rate this a perfect 10 or at least just under like the first four episodes i truly enjoyed watching and i dont regret it in the least but this does have shortcomings the ones the first part had and more as the first the humor just takes up too much space and this time around its even worse there are several new regular characters that are there for no other reason than to provide comic relief three of them no less scenes are set up and executed for no other reason than to make the audience laugh fine for a comedy but what is it doing in such a dark and unpleasant yes nothing short of sadistic at times horror piece helmers solitary secret hiding place of solitude is changed from the hospital roof from which he could see his beloved sweden to a bathroom with an angle from inside the bowl no you read that right in general the humor seems more lowbrow more sex and bodily function jokes which again begs the question why whilst most of the writing is excellent some of it is downright dire several scenes are basically copied from the first miniseriesone would guess due to their popularity when it aired at times the drama seems a bit more bombastic than that of the first and it jumps too much at times fortunately seldom but still noticeably plot points and items are explained away too easilya certain character living in denmark for no apparent reason for example anyone whos seen it knows who im speaking of the two dishwashers while still mysterious and insightful become too much of a gimmick too overexposed in the end i guess most of the scenes with them are still enjoyable though in addition to that i want to reassure any reader of this that in spite of all the negative things i have just written that this is still mostly good definitely enjoyable compelling powerful and in my humble opinion it should definitely be seen by anyone who liked the firstthough if belong in that group do not expect to feel that the story is finished after watching this any more than you did after the first i recommend this to any fan of lars von trier and anyone who enjoyed the first riget and wants more where that came from i urge anyone whos even considering watching this to make sure youve seen all of the first before you do i bought this before i bought the first but i held out on watching until i had bought the first and watched that and i cant tell you how glad i am that i did though this features a brief summary of the events in the first there are an immense amount of details and aspects that you would miss out on if you didnt see it before watching this slightly lesser sequel but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first 810
533,imdb lists this as 1972 for some reason but the other sources ive seen including the excellent program notes mark it as 68 doesnt really matter except that its quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video one of the first art works to merge the two apparently in the context of the star gate sequence in 2001 released the same year pure abstraction isnt really my thing but i can take it in small doses and the supersaturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers rohrschach blots birds etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s and deserves to be better known
534,the film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast and excellent direction by james eves the movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from stephanie beecham and everyone is perfectly cast james eves has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action fall and then rise to a climax he does this with an element of humour plenty of twists thrills and blood this is a return of the old vampire movie with loads of gore blood and screams the movie works at a great speed and the characters take you on a terrific adventurebut what makes it work is that the film doesnt take itself too seriously with plenty of tongue in cheek actiongreat 
535,stanley and iris is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life stanleys life is difficult because he never learned to read or write iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets stanley she decides to teach stanley how to read at her home in her spare time over time they become romantically involved after stanley learns to read he goes off to a good job in chicago only to return to iris and ask her to marry himits a really good film without nudity violence or profanity that which is rare in todays films a good film all round 
536,one of the best films ive ever seen robert duvalls performance was excellent and outstanding he did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life his character was so convincing it made me almost think i were in the theater watching it live i give it 5 stars
537,jag är nyfiken  yellow is a lot of fun like at least one other reviewer i was on numerous occasions laughing out loud yellow is energetic playful selfaware explorative dont expect bergman here this movie is about a youth in the early to mid60s in sweden and about the issues read contradictions that the nation and the world were facing at times yellow appears to be an earnest socialpolitical documentary with lena the main character and others interviewing both common people and politicians eg olaf palme at home at other times yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary all the while yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring lenas life  her home life her loves her political views her view of herself she is a complete person  complex flawed contradictory happy sad curious and placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director sjöman and his crew documenting themselves documenting lena it is this that for me really gives yellow wings not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice but their presence is itself another layer of the film they are filming themselves filming themselves i am reminded of a bjork music video with this same quality  a music video about the making of a music video ad infinitum with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish i think sjöman may have had something similar in mind while jag är nyfiken  yellow may not be everyones cup of tea it is certainly intelligent witty refreshing ebullient and authentic
538,hi all i am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6 i supposed i am quite obsessed by chess but hopefully not as much as the central character in this filmin this film the central character reflects a real chess player called curt von bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924 he is famous for a game he played against steinitz where a beautiful combination was played by steinitz instead of resigning he simply walked out of the tournament hall never to returnthe social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments chess i suppose is a very big sacrifice and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life a major example of this is the chess legend bobby fischer although a genius he was also very disturbed in many waysin the film a world championship match is depicted as between an italian grandmaster and luzhin the format is a knockout which actually the world governing body of fide has sometimes employed as a format itself  going from 128 players to just 2 in the final but this was a group knockout  which also depicts a realistic format where the winners of each group play against each otherthe position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself in fact i have done a youtube video about it for you to explore the winning combination in detail  enjoy httpukyoutubecomwatchvxzptdtphwdm best wishes tryfon
539,i never saw this when i was a kid so this was seen with fresh eyes i had never heard of it and rented it for my 5 year old daughter plus the idea of christopher walken singing and dancing made me curious the special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre but the story is great my daughter was entranced i loved watching walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him very amusing to see him dance and if the songs werent great at least they werent disney overproduced saccharine sweetness the ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end but it was mostly benign interestingly we had recently read puss in boots and i had wondered about the implausibility of the story but while staying true to almost every aspect walkens acting made it believable great fun id watch it again with my daughter
540,my comment would have been added to the release date section but i couldnt find a place for it i was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the us in feb 1955 i saw it in a first run theater in washington dc in march 1958 wonder if it was rereleased or some problem in my opinion this movie is very light entertainment but has some classic characters john mcintyre does a bangup job as a corrupt judgeentrepreneurthief walter brennan does basically the same role he did in red river years earlier and in my opinion james stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did i have seen this movie a half dozen times or more and never tire of seeing parts of it again the photography and scenery are splendid and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirtysix minutes
541,there are no people like show people marion davies as peggy pepper and william haines as billy boone my introduction to ms davies was a clip from this film the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions my introduction to mr haines was in viewing this film presently though its possible ive seen him in a less memorable role haines makes an incredible impression when he joins davies for a commissary meal  tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the dining table indeed haines and davies deliver great comic performancesthe story starts off with dell henderson colonel pepper driving daughter davies into hollywood certain she will become tinseltowns newest sensation indeed davies and the already arrived haines become comedy stars but davies yearns to become a true drama queen davies leaves haines and partners up with the dashingly dramatic paul ralli but audiences prefer davies in more comic roles perhaps director king vidor is offering up a case for art imitating life full of great hollywood location footage both on the set and off full of great cameos at a studio lunch at the stars table davies sits between douglas fairbanks and william s hart the best bit player however is charlie chaplin who has enough nerve to ask davies for her autograph while the cameos are fun they and the episodic sequences do help show people become less of an important film and more of an important historical document  show people 111128 king vidor  marion davies william haines dell henderson
542,i just watched this for the first time in a long time  i had forgotten both how imaginative the images were and how witty the movie is i had not forgotten however the opening scenes which are with the scene at the candlelight club in waterloo bridge among the most romantic ever filmedanyone interested in politics or history will love the movies offhand references  anyone interested in romance will be moved by hunterniven and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the depiction of the afterworldmy favorite movie remains odd man out made near the same time  but this one is superb 
543,this is one of those westerns that well stands practically alone in the unrelieved quality of its dialog very few can hold up to it over the long haul that said the rest is pretty bad nevertheless i am giving it an eight because there is no other western with such consistently good dialog with maybe the exception of the wild bunch junior bonner and perhaps a few more it is riddled with weaknesses john drew barrimore the most glaring however it does have one truly memorable scene nothing like it its right after kid wichita kills the sheriff and goes to jack elams place trying to goad him into a fight wonderful stuff right up with the best in any western
544,the first sidestory in the universal century gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies the focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyesthe story does contain some gundam staples its premise being the attempts by a zeon squad to capture an experimental gundam but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch this series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named alfred and the relationship between his neighbor christina mckenzie who is secretly a federation pilot and a newbie zeon pilot named bernie wiseman alfred develops a sort of brotherly love for bernie while our young zeon pilot also falls for christinawar in the pocket proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story there are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here this short 6 episode ova focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool he is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war the unlikely friendship and bonding between bernie and christina each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff same goes for the endearing relationship between alfred and bernie that being said i would not want to spoil much of the story here but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending despite its lack of action this show never falls into the category of boring the characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an ova and are sure to satisfy the craving for some mandatory mobile suit battles in a gundam seriesnormally watching anime in japanese or english i would leave up to personal preference but in this case i strongly recommend the english voice track over the japanese one not only do the characters whom all except alfred are caucasian sound more believable in english but the performances of the english voice cast are on par and even surpass the japanese one instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action tv dramasin short this show does not try to impress the audience what it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child a truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given
545,kenny doughty as jed willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star even though he keeps his pants onthe movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life i dont think i can think of another movie except perhaps zeffirellis romeo and juliet that captures that giddy joy that wellthe other draw of the movie is the very english eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously in that sense it is much the same appeal as midsomer murder or a miss marple mystery without the mayhemthis is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the usa an any relationships between people of different ages
546,i actually found this movie interesting finally one worth my time to watch and rent it is true some scenes were over the top on emotionalism shouting etc but what movie doesnt stress its agenda genre or ax to grind almost none what surprised me is that i read a review elsewhere done by a sfran reviewer on another review site but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his own review of the movie not of the movie at all anyone that watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends no car chases yea being in an italian family myself i can fully relate to the environment portrayed on the screen the movie has its tear jerking parts as well it is what real life can be in such an environment nice movie
547,can scarcely imagine a better movie than thishey before you all go chick flick on me i am a very large strong  masculine macho man who happens to think this was one of the better movies of the last 20 years the acting was superb and the story was marvelous this is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul the acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast i have known for a good while that mercedes ruehl along with holly hunter joan plowright dame edith evans sissy spacek judi dench is among the greatest actresses ever to appear on film and of course cloris leachman also in this film in my view may in fact exceed them all in the shear magnum of her talent and varied roles she has appeared in over the years at any rate this was an amazing cast this film was like a book that you cannot lay down and when you have reached the last page wish for morestill more i cannot for the life of me understand why this film here on the imdb only rates a 39that rating here is utterly amazing to me or perhaps not perhaps in fact i do understand it ever so well and that is what makes me really sad it makes me ever so sad that films like american beauty leaving las vegas sexy beast and fight club ratings skyrocket off the charts in popularity when they in fact at least in this viewers opinion should have received an r ratingr that is for rubbish hey ok i realize there are a lot of different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences but it is a sad commentary when this lovely powerfulextraordinarily directed acted and written film seems to be over looked it obviously was at the academy awards as wellhow sad and how predictable my summation is that if you want to see a powerful happy sad beautiful story watch preferably own this film
548,a river runs through it is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers norman and paul brad pitt and craig sheffer whose reverend father tom skerritt is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing  and for him and his sons there is a fine line between the two this story describes the slow progression of the brothers lives and how their lives separate on two different paths it is a touching movie narrated by the director robert redford playing the elderly norman and reflecting on times long gone and people long deadcertain themes recur in the movie such as memory death eternity and dreams most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of paul he is a capable charming and brave man but has his fatal flawsthe closing lines sum up the point of the movie then in the arctic halflight of the canyon all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the big blackfoot river and a fourcount rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise eventually all things merge into one and a river runs through it the river was cut by the worlds great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time on some of those rocks are timeless raindrops under the rocks are the words and some of the words are theirs i am haunted by waters
549,i saw this film at amsterdams international documentary film festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and tobias schneebaum all of whom are lively and outspoken new yorkers the films title in amsterdam was keep the river on your right making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent equally important was the loving  and gay  relationship tobias schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist his reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leavetaking were very moving i can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian
550,i will admit i thought this movie wasnt going to be any good but i soon changed my mind the movie was keep you guessing as which direction its going pierce broson is amazing in his role as a hit man who suddenly becomes burned out  asks a man he met at a mexican bar for help greg kinnear is an awesome straight man as his role as a mild mannered man from denver who starts a innocent conversation with pierce at a mexican bar the movie will have you laughing as pierce delivers hilarious one liners mostly about sexthe imaginary in this movie is very well done especially at the bullfight scene  when pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs
551,i am curious yellow a film in near seussical rhyme is said right at the start to be available in two versions yellow and blue was one of those big arthouse hits that first was a major sensation in sweden then a big scandalcausecelebre in the united states when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the supreme court whats potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of whats revealed in the sex or nudity the directoractor vilgot sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but its always moreso an intellectual expression than very lustlike but the daring of the attempt at a pure metafilm while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in sweden who knew such things in a generally peaceful country ie usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars could be so heatedup politically at least thats part of sjomans aim here like a filmmaker such as dusan makavajev with some of his works like wr if not as surreal and deranged or to a slightly lesser extent bertolucci sjoman is out to mix politics and sex mostly politics and social strata around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film the two characters lena and borje have a hotcold relationship in the story of the film where lena is a curious socialistwannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and trains sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend and as this is going on which is by itself enough for one movie sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film theres even a great bit midway through where as if at a rock concert title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are negating having to use end credits then with this theres a whole other dynamic as sjoman gives an actual performance not just a hey im the director playing the director bitat first one might not get this structure and that i am curious yellow is just a film where lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class socialism spain and franco and once in a while we see lenas father or bjore but sjoman does something interesting the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes its impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative documentary filmwithinafilm and even a serious interview with martin luther king who also acts as a quasiguru for lena it might not always be completely coherent analysis politically but it doesnt feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a godard picture the satire sjoman is after is akin to a godard but on a whole other wavelength his anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewerif i am curious yellow stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a fullblown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors it isnt entirely successful i think as an emotional experience where bergman had it down to a t with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors occasionally it works if only for the actors lena nyman mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even and borje ahlstedt a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile lena but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the innerfilm of lena and borje since perhaps intentionally sjoman fills it up with clichés borje has a girlfriend and kid will he leave her how will lena reconcile her father and a heavyhanded narration from his starlet of sortsand yet for whatever faults sjoman may have ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself i am curious yellow holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema or testing what couldnt be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage id even go as far as to say its influential and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time a specific technique used with the film rewinding towards the end is echoed in poorer usage in funny games and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avantgarde or metafilmmaking if its not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as wr or last tango its close behind
552,i went to a small advance screening of this movie on july 19th knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasyadventure quest of some sortthe plot line really is nothing like i have seen and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters in spite of what first impressions may give it isnt cheesy corny tacky or ridiculous and is actually highly entertaining and funny the flow is quite well done nothing seems rushed or dragged out the soundtrack for lack of better words is magical and adds much to the film as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or tv and even though i might have known what was coming at points i still couldnt bear to stop watching the screen to my knowledge not a single person left the theater during the entire moviemy one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film and as brilliant as it is i cant figure out why
553,surely one of the best british films ever made if not one of the best films ever made anywhere script cinematography direction and acting in a class on their own this film works on so many levels so why is it completely unavailable on tape dvd never shown on tv why is it hidden away when it is regularly shown at the national film theatre in london to packed houses
554,cecil b demille really knew how to create a classic and after 7 decades his western comes across as the real mccoy engrossing entertaining spectacular in no way outdatedas a real fan of tvs deadwood ill tell you the performances of gary cooper as wild bill hickock and jean arthor as calamity jane are far more ontargetwe dont have any giants in hollywood anymore plainsman is just one of dozens of classics from the 19361945 decade that have seen enduring commercial life decade after decade released reissued reissued all over again filmmakers like todays spielberg jackson bruckheimer are like kids playing in a sandbox none of todays movies will be sought out in 7 months let alone 70 years
555,released as zentropa in north america to avoid confusion with agniezska hollands own holocaust film europa europa this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise inspire or downright shock is a bizarre nostalgic elaborate film about a naive american in germany shortly following the end of wwii the american named leo doesnt fully get what hes doing there he has come to take part in fixing up the country since in his mind its about time germany was shown some charity no matter how that sounds he is not a nazi sympathizer or so much as especially progerman merely mixed up his uncle who works on the railroad gets leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 germanys horrors and enigmasthis progression starts when leo played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor jeanmarc barr meets a sultry heiress on the train played by barbara sukowa an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor she seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family which owns the company which manufactures the trains these were the precise trains that took jews to their deaths during the war but now they run a drab daytoday timetable and the womans uncle kessler postures as another one of those good germans who were just doing their jobs there is also udo kier the tremendous actor who blew me away in von triers shocking second film epidemic though here he is mere sceneryanother guest at the house is eddie constantine an actor with a quiet strength playing a somber american intelligence man he can confirm that uncle kessler was a war criminal though it is all completely baffling to leo americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than leo who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death trainthe story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the films danish director lars von trier whose anchor is in the films breathtaking editing and cinematography he shoots in black and white and color he uses doubleexposures optical effects and trick photography having actors interact with rearprojected footage he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects caught between glass for our more precise surveythis grand jury prizewinning surrealist work is allegorical but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer i interpret it as a film about the last legs of nazism symbolized by the train and the ethical accountability of americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads during the time frame of the movie and the nazi state and such significance to the train are dead but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexesthe characters music dialogue and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions the most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones two trains halting back and forth barr on one and sukowa on another an underwater shot of proliferating blood an uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown and most metaphysically affecting of all an anesthetic shot of train tracks as max von sydows voice allures us to hark back to europe with him and abandon our personal restraint
556,two great comedians in a great neil simon movie based on his hit playgreat combination especially when the comedians in question are matthau and burns small wonder why burns won an oscar for this hes as sharp and as funny as ever and matthau is every bit his match if a tad more crotchetythis is familiar simon territory two old vaudeville partners reunite for a tv special but still cant stand one another after all these yearsits a delight to watch these two pick at each other their scenes together make this film an absolute delight myself i especially enjoyed the knock knock knock  enter scene and if youre a fan of either burns or matthau youll enjoy it tooin fact youll enjoy the whole movie ten stars put a little sunshine in your life
557,simons carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by matthau and burns you can literally hear the script crackle there are few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script for example the famed reunion scene could have been a lot duller with lessquality actors involved matthau seems to had been born to play willie clark of course oscar moreso in the odd couple and with all of the little idiosyncracies and mannerisms that matthau crams into the character the line where he is arguing that he is with it since he lives in the city whereas lewis lives in the country that lewis is out of touch is the quintessential example of this make this one of the best performances ive ever seen of any actor in any role be it comedic or drama or whatever else period matthau and burns work excellently together the contrast they portray accentuates simons superb knack at creating comedic conflict this movie is simply one of the ultimate mustsees and does demand a rightful prestigious place in the pages of film history
558,this movie is a very realistic view of a police squad in a small german town as seen through the eyes of a woman recruit she brings her way of dealing with the law which means more than simple convictions the strong performance of the main character supported by good dialogues makes this flick very enjoyable
559,vince lombardi high school has a new principalthe evil ms togar mary woronov she intends to ban rock and roll music all together she butts head with riff randall pj soles who loves the ramones also the head of the school football team vincent van patten cant seem to connect with any girlnot realizing cute kate rambeau dey young is in love with himan instant midnight movie this was put in general release and almost immediately bombedbut as a midnight movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the 1980s i remember attending more than a few of those when i was in collegeit was like a party people were singing along with the songs laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having funseeing it now as an adult i cant imagine why i loved this so much the script is juvenile and full of groaners that i couldnt believe i was hearing characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place what saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by soles and woronov who is really enjoying herself also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles way over the top as they should as for the ramonesi was never a fan i do like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me if youre a ramones fan you might give this a higher ratingspoiler warning this is mostly for kids it has a pg rating who will probably find it silly but fun i especially think theyll like the end when the high school is blown up spoiler endso if youre in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this otherwise stay away i give it a 7
560,i saw this film while at birmingham southern college in 1975 when it was shown in combination with the red balloon both films are similar in their dreamlike quality the bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner a little boy is away at school a cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are and begins to warily stalk his prey the boy begins his walk home from school and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend the fish becomes agitated by the cats presence and finally jumps out of the bowl the cat quickly walks over to the fish gently picks him up with his paws and returns him to his bowl the boy returns happily to his fish none the wiserthe ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity it is hard to imagine how the director couldve pulled the technical feat back in 1959  it seems more a trick for 2003if you can find it watch it  you wont be disappointed and if you do find it let me know so i can get a copy too
561,this movie is such a moving amazing piece of work i saw it at the theater when it came out but i was only 13  didnt really quite get it i saw it again when i was 20 on video of course  i now own it  was just blown away steven spielberg created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end i have read the book as well but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life the casting acting music costuming scenery everything it just wonderful you laugh you cry you cheer it brings out every emotion imaginable it is one of his finest pieces of work  should not be missed
562,this movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen the writerdirector is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives which all add to the gripping hold it will have on you insomniacs nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you have seen is it a dream or reality this indie will have you discussing the twists and turns it takes through the conscious and subconscious it has an eery feel with its dark interpretations of illusions dominic monaghan really became the insomniac he is a great actor who is not hard on the eyes either he really poured his whole being into this role from the storyline to the way it is shot makes this indie one of my favorites i recommend it highly and eagerly await to see more from this innovative creative writerdirectorcinematographer
563,probably the best film of the year for me this small french film centers on put upon office secretary carla emmanuelle devos who spends her days doing other mens jobs uncredited and being the source of their scorn and lunchtime conversation which is all too clear to her as being partially deaf she reads lips a change is set in motion when she hires newly paroled con paul vincent cassel as her assistant the relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film mutual dependency for vastly different reasons bonds them carla becomes attracted to paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive forwhat seems likethe first time paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help he owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him which will involve carlas skill of reading lips i think the main thing that pushes the film way above an average suspensedrama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars throughout the whole film no matter what other characters are on screen you can feel this amazing bond between carla and paul i cannot remember when i have witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors emmanuell devos gives a brilliant performance she won the french cesar for best actress you never feel like you are watching a piece of acting this really is carla the chameleon like vincent cassel is also wonderful he makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive i loved this film because of these two people and both times when i had finished watching it i wanted to go back into the cinema and become involved with them all over again
564,i gotta say clive barkers undying is by far the best horror game to have ever been made ive played resident evil silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements barker is good at what he does which is attach the horror to our world and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game heck even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title i just wish that this had made it to a console system but alas poor pc sales nipped that one in the bud
565,jodie foster cherie currie the former lead singer of the seminal allgirl rock group the runaways in her remarkably able acting debut marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are uniformly believable splendid and touching as the titular quartet who are a tightknit clique of troubled fiercely loyal adolescent girls with negligent uncaring selfabsorbed parents who do their best to grow up and fend for themselves in the affluent san fernando valley california suburbs the girls are forced to make serious decisions about sex drugs alcohol commitment and so on at a tender young age when theyre not fully prepared to completely own up to the potentially harmful consequences of said decisions foster giving one of her most perceptive affecting and underrated performances to date is basically the groups den mother who presides over the wellbeing of both herself and the others shes especially concerned about the goodhearted but reckless and selfdestructive currie whose carelessly hedonistic lifestyle makes her likely to meet an untimely endthis picture offers a poignant insightful often devastatingly credible and thoroughly absorbing examination of broken dysfunctional families which exist directly underneath suburbias neatly manicured surface and the tragic net result of such families tough resilient but unhappy and vulnerable kids who have to confront the trials and tribulations of growing up on their own because their parents are either too inconsiderate or even nonexistent adrian fatal attraction jacobs ladder lynes direction is both sturdy and observant while gerald ayres script is somewhat messy and rambling but overall still accurate in its frank gritty unsentimental depiction of your average latchkey kids nervewrackingly chaotic capricious and unpredictable everyday life leon bijous soft dewy almost pastoral cinematography properly suggests a delicate and easily breakable sense of tranquility and innocence giorgio moroder arranged the excellent score which makes particularly effective use of donna summers elegiac on the radio the topnotch cast includes sally kellerman as fosters neurotic insecure peevish mother scott baio as a sweet skateboarder dude randy quaid as kagans rich older boyfriend british 60s pop singer adam faith as fosters feckless absentee rock promoter father and lois smith as kagans smothering overprotective mother appearing in brief bits are robert romanus mike damone fast times at richmont high as one of fosters morose exboyfriends and a gawky braceswearing laura dern as an obnoxious party crasher achingly authentic engrossing and deeply moving curries grim ultimate fate is very heartbreaking foxes is quite simply one of the most unsung and underappreciated teen movies made about early 80s adolescence
566,this movie is perfect for all the romantics in the world john ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie sam hits close to home is lovely to look at and so much fun to play along with ben gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with im sure ive met arthur in my travels somewhere all around an excellent choice to pick up any evening
567,i always tell people that enchanted april is an adult movie with no cussing no sex and no violence one might think of it as the ultimate chick flick but i bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who love it too dont invite the kids though this movie is very lowkeyseeing enchanted april is a very healing experience the sound track and gorgeous scenery along with the ladies gentle manners bring to mind the peace and beauty of a preraphaelite paintinglest anyone think yours truly only watches one kind of movie i will paraphrase a line i heard once on saturday night live and say that my two favorite movies are the deer hunter and enchanted april
568,an insomniacs nightmare is the story of a mans plunge into insanity having chronic insomnia jack is plagued by hallucinations causing him to try and determine what is real and what isntwe find out interesting things about jack near the end and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a happily ever after hollywood ending wrong this is new york city the place where nobody sleepstess nanavati writer and director has herself a good film in an insomniacs nightmare a talented filmmaker and writer she made this film right after her high school graduation she has real potential and will be one to watch in the upcoming futureas i watched this short film i was constantly uncomfortable between the music bleak scenery and realistic portrayal of an insomniac by dominic monaghan as jack i desperately wanted to turn this off at times just to escape from it
569,a give this movie a 1010 because it deserves a 1010 two of the best actors of their timewalter matthau  george burns collaborate with neil simon and all of the other actors that are in this film  director herbert ross and all of that makes this stage adaption come true the sunshine boys is one of the best films of the 70s i love the type of humor in this film it just makes me laugh so hardi got this movie on vhs 3 days ago yes vhs because it was cheaperonly 3 i watched it as soon as i got home but i had to watch it again because i kept missing a few parts the first time the second time i watched it it felt a lot better and i laughed a lot harder im definitely going to reget this on dvd because i have to see the special featuresits very funny how that happens two people work together as entertainersactorsperformers they get along well on stage but really argue off stage they cant survive another minute with each other then some 15 years later you want to reunite them for a tv special you can find that in this film matthau  burns were terrific in this film its a damn shame they died george burns deserved that oscar he gave a strong comic performance he was also 78 when this movie was filmed so far hes the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age jessica tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress richard benjamin was also fantastic in this he won a golden globe for best supporting actor he deserved that golden globe although many people might disagree with what i am about to say everybody in this film gave a strong performance this comedy is an instant classic i highly recommend it one more thing whoever hates this film is a putz
570,the only reason i wanted to see this was because of orlando bloom simply put the movie was spectacularly average its not bad but its really not very good the editing is good the film is wellpaced the direction is competent and assured the story is plodding the film is averagely acted by ledger bloom and the normally great watts and rush the accents are impenetrable if youre from the us so just sit back and enjoy the scenery or as i like to call it orlando bloom by the end of the film i was neither bored nor moved some people have asked what happened to ned kelly at the end of the movie i have to say i so did not care by that pointreally the only reason i can recommend this is that orlando bloom kind of sort of shows some hints of range although the oftpresent im pretty and confused look is prominent so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price other than that just dont see it its neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining
571,this was one of the dvds i recently bought in a set of six called frenchfilm to brush up our french before our planned holiday in beautiful provence this year so far as well as improving our french we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of french cinemawhat a breath of fresh air to the stale predictable unimaginative crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by hollywood what a good example for screenplay writers actors directors and cinematographers to follow it was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures the other thing i liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly naïve benefactor with the type of contempt that an excon would display will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her the viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each otheronce you have seen this film like me you may want to see it again i still have to work out the directors psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look the plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office you must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place but if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of french cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied four stars out of five for me
572,when john wayne filmed his alamo story he had built a complete alamo set in the town of brackettsville texas which is still there and quite the tourist attraction as long as that stands we will have a set for future alamo interpretations for the screen one such with dennis quaid and billy bob thornton was done in this centurybut i would say the alamo thirteen days to glory is the best alamo story filmed ive seen john waynes film is a good one if overhyped but its a john wayne film with the story redone to fill parameters of screen character of john wayne brian keith plays davy crockett here and gives a fine interpretation of the rollicking frontier character he wasits a lot closer to professor lon tinkles book on the alamo than the wayne film was and having read the book years ago i can attest to that tinkles book is listed as the source in both films but tinkle who was alive back then when the wayne film was done and he was not pleased with the resultalec baldwin was around the right age for young william barrett travis the idealistic freedom fighter who incidentally was a slave owner back in the day no one saw the ironic contradiction in that one thing that was not explored and hasnt been was traviss hyperactive sex drive he was the casanova of the southwest he even kept a salacious diary of his libidinal conquestsbut the man who always gets the whitewash is jim bowie played here by james arness he was a hero at the alamo to be sure but his career before the alamo was that of a scoundrel he was a smuggler a slave trader an all around con man selling land he had questionable title to but his heroic death certainly redeemed him no hint of that is in arnesss portrayal nor any others ive seen of bowie on the screen and of course he did design the bowie knife done to his specifications that man needed such a weaponhowever the main asset that the alamo thirteen days to glory has is a full blown portrayal of antonio de lopez de santa anna the president of mexico who comes up personally to put down the rebellion stirred up by the north americans whove come to settle in texas at mexican invitation unfortunately those americans came with some preconceived notions about liberty that just hadnt made it that far south at least liberty for white people raul julia plays santa anna who remains an even more controversial figure in mexican history he was also quite the scoundrel but he was the best mexico produced until a genuine reformer named benito juarez came alongthis film was the farewell performance of lorne greene who appears briefly as general sam houston greenes not quite my conception of houston he really was way too old for the part houston was in his early forties in 1836 he was not yet the patriarch of texas but within the limits imposed on him greene does a fine jobfor a romantic telling of the alamo tale by all means see john waynes version but for historical content i recommend this film highly
573,this movie is soooo funny the acting is wonderful the ramones are sexy the jokes are subtle and the plot is just what every high schooler dreams of doing to hisher school i absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism if you like monty python you will love this film this movie is a tad bit greaseesk without all the annoying songs the songs that are sung are likable you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is through this musical ranks number two in musicals to me second next to the blues brothers but please do not think of it as a musical per say seeing as how the songs are so likable it is hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene is taking place i think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance you will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager needless to say you will be reminiscing of your old high school days after seeing this film highly recommended for both the family since it is a very youthful but also for adults since there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience
574,i went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister instead i had to really control myself in order to convince her that i was not scared in many ways still a childrens story but with a screenplay that has a lot of potential could have been one of the scariest movies if planned for another audience
575,part of the enjoyment that i took from this film stemmed from the fact that i knew nothing more about it than that it starred john turturro and emily watson 2 reasons enough to watch was a period piece and involved chess everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected i shant therefore give away much more suffice to say that turturro is magnificent as an eccentric obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and em matches him step for step as the strongminded woman who is drawn to him its about love and obsession rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour became totally compelling and i defy anyone to secondguess the ending
576,sunday july 16 800pm the castro san franciscoas a southern colonel your makeup is very indianathe yammering gossips of hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in marion davies direction over the years that she had fame handed to her and was undeserving is often speculated considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into this criticism would seem to have some validity as a comedienne however her star shone very brightly left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled mabel normand one of her better outings was king vidors show people 1928 which survives and is so well known largely because mgm filled it with star cameos this happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars davies and that notorious joe college wisecracker william haines rumor has it show people was loosely based on the life of gloria swanson who began in sennett comedies and rose to grand drama and dont think she didnt spend the rest of her life reminding everyone with von stroheim walsh and demille coincidentally the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs keystone had abandoned the year before think of who worked therecolonel marmaduke oldfish pepper dell henderson drives his daughter peggy davies from georgia to hollywood to star in the movies these two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible billy boone haines   a custard pie artist  who descends on their cafeteria table in an outrageously funny entrance watch for the bit with the noodle and then helps peggy land a part in his next picture what she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball but a job is a job and billy convinces her    all the stars have to take it on the chin   at the preview billy and peggy bump into  charlie chaplin who asks for her autograph she pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified billy grabs the book and makes her sign chaplin climbs in his car and billy tells peggy who shes just snubbed so naturally she faints its so very funny considering davies character isnt supposed to recognize this guy peggy soon moves on to work at the high art studios changes her name to patricia pepoire and leaves poor billy behind davies does a wonderful sendup of a serious actress with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips vidor throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot and theyre all sitting shoulder to shoulder facing the camera that includes polly moran whos also sensationally funny playing davies maid louella parsons one of the friendly vampires estelle taylor claire windsor aileen pringle the comedy duo of karl dane with his arm in a sling and george k arthur pretending hes stealing the silverware leatrice joy amused by arthurs antics renee adoree rod eating and smoking la rocque mae murray john in a robe gilbert who also appears driving through the mgm gates early in the picture norma eeeww talmadge looking bitchy and aloof as usual and patricia dressed like marie antoinette sandwiched between douglas fairbanks as he does an amusing trick and william s hart protecting her from doug billy runs into the high art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming with predictably nutty results vidor even works himself into the final scene as the director of peggys current production also worth noting are harry gribbon as the comedy director doing a great caricature of eddie sedgwick sidney bracy as the dramatic director who cant get peggy to cry for her screen test and then cant stop her once she does and paul ralli as andre her dramatic love interest and a hilarious phony when her character tries to act its as though davies is poking fun at all the awful dramas shed been forced into and shes brilliant doing itwhile its true show people is a hokey satire of the good ole days ten years hence it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from mgm irving thalberg and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent what a shame so much has been lost there are also far too many examples of great films like the patsy 1928 vidor and davies hugely successful comedy from earlier that same year languishing in vaults when they could be seen and enjoyed
577,like i said at the top four stars just arent enough its one of the best films ive ever seen in my almost 17 years of life for the people that dont really like it or understand it you must not have a real appreciation for art or you might have a short attention spaneven if i havent seen all his films yet id have to say that this is spielberg at his peak its pretty sad to see that movies as great as the color purple dont come along too often cause i think all of us are in desperate need of firstclass motion picture entertainment in these hard timesmovies like this are more than just movies theyre pieces of art that need to be appreciated morethe idea that it was nominated for 11 oscars even best picture of the year and didnt get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid hollywood can be sometimes spielberg wasnt even nominated for best director it should have swept the oscars that yearthe film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some peopleif only movies were still this good
578,going into seeing this movie i was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea especially a romantic fantasylittle did i know that i was in for a ride through cinematic magic everything in the movie from plot to dialogue to effects was very near perfectionclaire danes shines like the star she is in this movie from beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this charactermichelle pfeiffer is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beautyrobert de niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climaxoverall this was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan if you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for the kids and adults alike stardust is the way to go
579,the great talents of michael powell and emeric pressberger are noticeable in their wonderful a matter of life and death it was part of the recent tribute to mr powell that played at the walter reade in new york this film in particular shows us one of the best british films from that or any other eraa matter of life and death has a brilliant cinematography by jack cardiff a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera particularly impressive is the contrast from the monochromatic tones given to the scenes played in heaven and the colored ones when the action comes back to earth this was quite a coup and well ahead of its times the black and white sequence that involves the long staircase where peter and the conductor are chatting has to be one of the most amazing things on any filmmuch has been said in this forum about the film so our comment will be about the great acting powell and pressberger got out of the large distinguished cast who responded magnificently to the directors guidancedavid niven is peter whose aircraft is hit and his best friend dies as a result of it this film marked one of the highlights in mr nivens career he was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie kim hunter is surprisingly good as june the woman who talked to peter as his plane was falling from the skies as fate would have it peter and june fall in love at first sightsome of the best british film actors grace this film with their presence robert coote is bob the man who is admitted to heaven but he is surprised his friend peter never made the trip with him an excellent star turn by marius goring who as the conductor 71 steals the film mr goring who had worked with the directors is one of the best things in the movie also roger livesey as dr frank reeves does one of the best appearances of his career as well as raymond massey who is seen as abraham farlana matter of life and death is a timeless film that will always be seen with gratitude toward its creators
580,sammo has to have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything great story great fights great characters and great cameosthis film sees dick wei take on billy chow and chong fat sammo takes on lau kar leung in a casino sammo loses the fight but what a fight it is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown insome great and touching moments in the film lam ching ying pops up in a cameo and gets killed off  guttedthe end sequence will have you reaching for the rewind button as its one of the best end fights ive seen sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up squaring up to billy chow
581,the plainsman is an entertaining western no doubt a classic which is actual even today gary cooper is wild bill hickok ideal for the role together with john wayne and james stewart they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation jean arthur is great as calamity jane nobody that i know played it better than her even if might not be historically accurate the film manages to capture the most important about hickok and about the time it takes place sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that is what demille does here the friendship of hickok with buffalo bill the selling of rifles to the indians by a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have because of the end of the civil war custer and little big horn the uneasy relationship between buffalo bills wife a religious woman with hickok a man who had killed plenty also the unusual love affair between hickok and calamity all this makes the plainsman a non conventional and interesting film anthony quinn has a very short appearance that already shows what a great actor he was going to become a lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time
582,if youre a fan of film noir and think they dont make em like they used to here is your answer they just dont make em in hollywood anymore we must turn to the french to remember how satisfying subtle and terrific a wellmade film from that genre can be read my lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful from director jacques audiard featuring sharp storytelling and fine performances from emmanuelle devos and vincent casselthe basic plot could have been written in the 40s dumb but appealing excon and a smart but dowdy femme fatale who turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious discover each other while living lives of bleak desperation and longing manipulate each other to meet their own ends develop complex lovehate relationship cook up criminal scheme involving heist double crosses close calls and lots of money all action takes place in depressing seedy andor poorly lit locations audiard has fashioned some modern twists of course the femme fatale is an underappreciated office worker who happens to be nearly deaf and uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her and where you might expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film but make no mistake  this is old school film noir its as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films ive seen all year
583,this story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine the immortal charles dickens story has been recreated in every possible way imagine i admit i have not seen the classic alistair sim version and im sure someday i will but i would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version i believe that if dickens himself had created his story for film this would be itthe story is well known i wont go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another a rich stingy mean old man is visited by the ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways in order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with past present and future finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts retribution for all the wrong he has donegeorge c scott is absolutely undeniably perfect for this role he takes hold of the ebeneezer scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character he is not just a mean old man but someone who has been effected by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world there is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to scroogenot only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place this is a grand epic of victorian england dickens england is recreated before our very eyes the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market director clive donner brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination i could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery its not spectacular scenery per se but its real the film takes us from the high class traders market to the very dismal pits of poverty and everything in betweenthe rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life bob cratchitt played by david warner and his entire family including and especially the young tiny tim played by anthony walters were wonderful the ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story a christmas carol is not a light story dickens wrote this story for a dark period in englands life and its one of the few christmas tales that is really dark almost scary and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around the dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures christmas miracles the score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether its the actual score or the christmas music everything fits together apparently christmas movies are my favorite because i insist everyone see this christmas carol above all others 1010
584,after erasing my thoughts nearly twentyseven times there is a feeling that i can now conquer this review for the complex french drama read my lips having written over five hundred reviews i have never found myself at such a loss of words as i did with director jacques audiards subtle yet inspirational love story thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film and while the loves overpowered it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind read my lips is a drama to be more precise is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work here is where this review begins to crumble it is all of these items  but it is moremuch much more as a viewer you are pulled in instantly by emmanuelle devos portrayal of this fragile woman named carla whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid causing an immediate unrest not only from the characters within the film but to those watching without sound the world is left open to any possibility and that is frighteningas we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet paul played exquisitely by vincent cassel a slickedback hair mustachewearing lanky man who was just released from prison homeless jobless and forced by his parole officer to get a job this is how carla and paul meet there is that moment of instant unsettling attraction the one where we think she loves him but he is dark and here is where it gets even more fun  and where we think he loves her but she is dark the constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown who as viewers are we to feel the most sympathy for paul sleeps in the office carla helps him carla looses a contract to a rival coworker paul helps her carlas ability to read peoples lips comes in handy for a makeshift idea for paul the continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave it never does audiard cannot just allow this story to take place he continually introduces us to more characters one just as seedy as the next even our rock our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing  a subplot to this film that at first angered me but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film yet none of this could have happened if it werent for our characters devos solemn and homely look is breathtaking as she changes her image for paul the truth of her beauty is discovered paul the wildcard in the film continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame then just as we assume one carla takes on one last shapeaudiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters cassel and devos could just play cards the entire time and i would still be sitting at the end of my chair the story probably the weakest part of this film is at first random the interwoven stories seem unconnected at first but audiard lets them connect bit by bit again the entire parole officer segment was tangent but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means not attempting to sound vague but this complex yet utterly simple story is difficult to explain there is plenty happening but it is up to you to connect the pieces a favorite scene is when carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held that use of sound and scene was brilliant it was tense it was dramatic and it was like watching a whodunit mystery unfold before your eyesoverall i initially though this was a mediocre french film that i could easily forget about when it was over  i was proved wrong read my lips opens the floor for discussion not just with the characters but the situations one will find themselves rooting for carla in one scene and paul in the next when a discovery is made in pauls apartment by carla i found myself deeply angry audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development and what he was lacking in plot  the actors were able to carry i can easily suggest this film to anyone but be prepared this isnt a one time viewing film repeat repeat repeatgrade  out of 
585,for a no budget movie this thing rocks i dont know if americas gonna like it but we were laughing all the way through some really funny funny stuff really nonhollywoodthe actors and music rocked the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up whooo whoooive seen some of the actors before but never in anything like this one or two of them i think ive seen in commercials or in something somewhere basically it rocked luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors
586,yokai daisenso is a childrens film by takashi miike but as you might expect its probably a bit too dark  scary for younger ones however older children may well eat this up that is if you play it dubbed in englishthe story is that of a young boy who has moved with his mother to the country to live with his grandfather after a divorce during a village festival the boy is chosen as a kirin rider a great honor but with that honor comes much danger and adventure of coursemeanwhile evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt gogo boots  a beehive hairdo teams up with an evil yokai to turn peoples resentments and discarded items against them and this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the city of rage itself tokyo one quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the citysays one oh its only gamera the young boy has befriended yokai which are monsters of a kind mostly benign that have isolated themselves away from humans and all the yokai in japan band together to fight the evilin many ways miike  crew have taken the late 60searly 70s yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for older kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of transformers the look and feel of the film is great the effects are entertaining and some of the humor will just sail right over kids heads but still older ones might enjoy it as for adults theres not much here not to like if youre a fan of japanese monster movies youll enjoy the heck out of thiscool  fun stuff kind of dark at times but perhaps thats just miikeand what a wild ride 8 out of 10
587,convicts is very much a third act sort of film all the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long winddown of a late southern day and by extension the life of its main character soll robert duvallthis is the first collaboration of director peter masterson and writer horton foote six years earlier the worked together on the trip to bountiful a film that seems almost actionpacked in comparison to this one masterson is not necessarily a good director in fact hes just barely this side of adequate the slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer toyomichi kurita who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light  warmthbecause this is essentially a filmed play with little in the way of editing or directing prowess it all comes to the acting as far as im concerned theres no flaws here robert duvall and james earl jones two of the best american actors both born in january 1931 create characters that are wholly real uninterested in anything besides living lukas haas a young actor who i was familiar with from testament and witness plays a character very much like his other early roles he is quiet withdrawn slightly scared and sad somehow these are qualities that seem natural from himperhaps a title like convicts is a disservice to this film that title along with the opening scene seem to create an image of a far more highstrung western type picture if slowpaced stage productions dont interest you terribly youll want to pass on this one as well otherwise this might be exactly the film you wish they made more oftenenjoy
588,i have to agree with most of the other posts was it a comedy a drama to me it leaned a little to much towards the comedy side i could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived jamie keeps running into the julio and whats his name in new york how many times do you run into someone you know in downtown clevelandand just how could robert pastorelli dig up yankee stadium to hide the gold again a comedy or drama but it was still entertaining especially for a sunday morning i enjoyed kimberly elises performance she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously she is a younger actress that is going to be viable
589,the great vincent price has done many fantastic horror films some of which range among the greatest genre gems of alltime prices greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s with films such as roger cormans brilliant poecycle still the greatest horror cycle of alltime michael reeves witchfinder general 1968 or ubaldo ragonas the last man on earth 1964 marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant mans career the films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal horror icon he is however date back to the 50s with house of wax 1953 marking his rise to stardom the mad magician of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor this is not to say however that this film isnt an original delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself as the lines above may suggest vincent price is my favorite actor and while i personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gemprice stars as don galico aka galico the great an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices whose boss a sleazy businessman stole his wife eva gabor from him when the boss takes away one of galicos ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival the great rinaldi john emery galico snaps and a murderous spree of revenge beginsdont we love vincent price when hes out for revenge some of his most famous and greatest films such as the abominable dr phibes 1971 or theater of blood 1973 were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders and this earlier film in his horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as vincent price does this film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for price who as always delivers a brilliant performance and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every horror fan another mustsee for my fellow price fans
590,how can you go wrong with the amazing ramones what a crime that two of them are already dead it reminds me of the dennis leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever im paraphrasing here but you get the idearock and roll high school tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high schools administration its extremely silly stuff but theres an optimism about it thats refreshing even if they do resort to blowing up the building who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world rock and roll high school is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society its full of kids who know authority doesnt have the correct answers rather rock and roll is the only thing they can trustbut most important this is pure exploitationtake none of it seriously just go in and have a good time if this wasnt what high school life was like in the seventies then it should have been
591,this movie is incredible if you have the chance watch it although a warning youll cry your eyes out i do every time i see it and i own it and have watched it many times the performances are outstanding it deals with darkness and pain and loss but there is hope this movie made me look at the world differently vicarious experience according to my english teacher also if youve seen it note the interesting use of shadows and light home room is a phenomenal movie and i rate it 1010  for real  because of the excellent acting amazing plot and heartwrenching dialogue very tense very moving doesnt give all the answers but makes many good points about humankind
592,i was dragged to this movie about four years ago by a french actress friend of minefor the first half hour i was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the new beverly theater in hollywood hating this film hating myself and even hating the french actress and theni dont know what happened but i was pulled into the film in a way that i hadnt been in years and this was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and they had to do each changeover by hand i was in the theater for close to four hours but it was worth it i believe that great movies pull you inside a world make you a part of it and then drop you off to talk about with your friends over coffee or a drink this film did that it was one of the best filmgoing experiences i have ever had 
593,i havent seen this movie in about 5 years but it still haunts me when asked about my favorite films this is the one that i seem to always mention first there are certain films works of art like this film dark city and breaking the waves that seem to touch a place within you a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer not unlike a lifechanging event such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend this film shook me when i first saw it it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days
594,i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such an impressive movie without any music but it is just the pictures watch out for that picture anne talking with that little boy benny bout the soul really strong might make you feel different
595,those who know who know the kelly legend  are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film eg naomi watts character never existed in reality but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment it holds up pretty well ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid taking the mantle of cinemas best ned not hard considering the previous neds include yahoo serious mick jagger  former carlton champion australian rules football bob chitty a great footballer but a poor actor some location shooting film in the area i live bacchus marsh outside melbourne as well as clunes  ballarat
596,a chance encounter between a salesman and a hitman changes both their lives this is an odd film that works an impressive effort for writerdirector shepard in a daringly unglamorous role that is a far cry from james bond brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hitman who starts to buckle under the stress of his job but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope kinnear is equally good as the salesman a decent fellow with a void in his life davis is fine as kinnears flirtatious wife mainly a character study the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable an extremely dark comedy
597,i suppose jedi is now chronologically to be considered the very last entry in the popular saga and its a very good one as were several of these i liked how directly this sequel took off after the empire strikes back and i appreciated the maturity of luke skywalker as a characterand also mark hamill as an actor after hearing so many negative things about the ewoks they werent so bad i enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods and i felt there was a lot of wellrealized emotion with this chapter the ending with some new additions i presume successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy i know many true star wars fans hated george lucas for changes he made to the original films but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what i didnt already know i think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity oh and err  carrie fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit
598,as i drove from skagway alaska to dawson cityyukon a couple of years ago and was impressed with the scenery i cannot help but wish that this film even though it has beautiful color and scenic views would have been shot in the actual location jasper in the canadian rockies is a magnificent place but still not the real place where the film takes place when the story moves to dawson that is when i feel anthony mann who used the outdoor locations so well could have made the most if he filmed in the actual place james stewart here is again a man fighting within himself one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered ruth roman is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps corinne calvet is the nice girl mann is excellent directing the shootouts but the high point of the film is how well he does in the outdoor scenes he uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery the predominating white like it was with the greens in the naked spur and the browns in the man from laramie like all of the mannstewarts this is a traditional western with a difference in the elaboration of stewarts character which is more complex
599,this is a refreshing enjoyable movie if you enjoyed four weddings and a funeral peters friends etc you will see a number of familiar and talented actors made me laugh made me sad i view movies for entertainment and englishset movies generally fit that bill for me enjoy
600,although george c scott is the only actor in this version of acc without a british accent he more than makes up for it with his overthetop and largerthanlife interpretation of ebenezer scroogeparticularly effective is when he confronts bob cratchit in his office at the movies end as scott stands before a large window sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him all you can see is his silhouette augmented by scotts voice a ponderous growl the effect is galvanizingmuch like marlon brandos first scene in apocalypse now the horror indeed however as they say the very thing that works for you can also work against you because scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie it proves infectious to put it another way the before scrooge is almost as charismatic as the after even though he really shouldnt be its what you might call the doctor smith effect since jonathan harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies stage and screen alikeactually i myself dont consider scotts glib rage a liability but other christmas carol purists might see the film and judge for yourselves
601,we loved the movie i am a mother to two little men i love having a movie i can watch with them where men have integrity and character moveis where money is not the most important thing and familys are forever and love means more then words i do wish we saw more of the davis family but over all i loved it left me with the same feeling the others did please dont be over we both wish actors would not changethe new actors were good replacement thomy 9 year old son loved this movie too asked me to go buy them all he is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something family should all see this move buy it for friends  help bring back a time of values we will be reading the books now that we are hooked really hope to see more be blessed happy moving
602,rock n roll high school holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the ramones i was too young during the bands mid70s heyday to be very aware of them although i had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time i finally saw rnrhs on television one afternoon in the mid80s when i was about fifteen years old and laughed all the way through it isnt it every high school kids dream to trash his school and blow it up all set to a rockin soundtrack i recorded a subsequent airing of the film a year or two later and kept watching the ramones concert sequences over and over again thinking man these guys kick ass i have to check out some of their albums the rest is history twenty years umpteen ramones lpscassettescds and three ramones shows later theyre still one of my all time favorite bands and rnrhs still cracks me up every time i watch it now that joey dee dee and johnny have left us rip allat least we have this movie and tons of great music to remember them by
603,enterprise is the entertainment but it is also the forefront of science fiction and a positive outlook for tomorrow with gratitude and respect mr berman and mr braga i wish you well thank you both for your service to trekenterprise is what trek is about
604,as a massive fan of fantasy in general and of the works of neil gaiman in particular ive been looking forward to this film so avidly so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that i can scarcely believe its finally here and you know what i neednt have feared the film version is bldy awesome different from the book but in a good way  less whimsical more comical still deeply sweet and enchantingthe special effects are absolutely spoton and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusiveproper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing and the casting in the main is a triumph with the ghostly princes whose rollcall read almost as a whos who of currently cool british comedy  rupert everett david walliams of little britain fame two of the blokes from green wing etc stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the films funniest moments which exist in abundance in fact the one minor criticism i have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little ott subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story ricky gervais cameo for example was far too much just ricky gervais doing his usual david brent from the office comedy persona for my liking and in my opinion created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story though in fairness from memory i believe the ferdy character in the original book was pretty ricky gervaisesquire when i think back on itbut this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance charlie cox as the protagonist tristan captures the correct mixture of naivety subtle comedy and selfrealisation required for a story like this where a humble young boy embarks on lifechanging quest claire danes as yvaine is beautiful feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal a perfect interpretation of her stellar role robert de niro in the cameo every reviewer is talking about is indeed deserving of praise rollicking good fun looks like hes having a ball too and michelle pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch lamia my favourite performance of the film overall if you enjoyed her deliciously btchy performance in the recent hairspray then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this tooso to round off this review you will laugh for sure you will smile and you may even cry  stardust is a beautiful heartwarming fairytale for all the family with a heart of gold and more sass n smarts than is immediately apparent one of my alltime favourite films is the absolutely fantastic princess bride and stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory and just as the princess bride remains fresh smart and funny twenty years after its initial release i believe that the delicious tongueincheek sweetness of stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions or equivalent future device for many years to come
605,dont listen to fuddyduddy critics on this one this is a gem young rich joan and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies  and now they have to work for a living she naturally becomes a reporter and he just as naturally a driver for the mob by wild coincidences their careers meet head on thanks to gangster clark gable in the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for joan to do a couple of risque dance numbers with all the grace of a steamshovelbut none of this is supposed to be taken seriously  its all good fun from those wonderful precode days when hollywood was really naughty joan looks great and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity thank god she stopped the dancing gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster  he wasnt a star yet and so didnt have to be the hero great to see him playing something different and william bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother and there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director harry beaumont who moves the piece on with a cracking pace  and an occasional wink to the audience great fun
606,im a huge classic film buff but am just getting in to silent movies a lot of silent films dont hold my attention but show people is a notable exceptionmarion davies and william haines are simply wonderful in this picture davies in particular shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriouslyshow people is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era the movie captured my attention immediately and i actually forgot that it was a silent film i know that doesnt make much sense but thats what happened the actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessaryshow people is a perfect introduction to silent films it is a fast paced interesting film with two of the silent eras best stars add in the satire of hollywood and show people should be on the must see list for all classic film buffs
607,okay first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free first  this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3d it is for the most part but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2d what its not that hard to film in a car second  the story isnt very good there are a lot of things wrong with itthird  why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed watch it for a good laugh  but dont waste your time buying it just download it or something for cheap
608,i watch most movies that nick mancuso is in because frankly i love the guy even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie longtime fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick its a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot but then most movies these days arent exactly original but rick roberts is appealing as the imperfect husband martha macisaac is equally appealing as the daughter and mitzi kapture does a good job if that was her goal of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like nick has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis however too much of the plot takes place offscreen  like motivation prior behaviors good times and bad times  and things that seem apparent to the characters never quite make it to the audience ie me the final scene leaves everything to be desired in the but what about category and overall i cant say that i cared much about any of the characters that being said it was what it was  a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon  and i still like nick
609,while to most people watching the movie this will be of little interest but out of the many hundreds of movies dealing with magic and the occult in one form or another this one is probably the best in many waysfrom the golem to the craft the subject seems to be of endless interest to the movie industry the majority of movies which touch on it in any way do so childishly for example witchboard a true piece of utter garbage in every way either taking the transcendental elements as cheap excuses for cheesy special effects or cardboard cutout villians cf warlock more frequently the subject comes up in an hysterical religious context in the various revelationsoriented movies the antichrist is inevitably an advocate of some kind of newage style practice rarely a movie seems to show at least some passing experience with magic as it is practiced in real life but the presentation of the occult in such movies can at best be described as allegorical and not literal or symbolic or  just not quite righti watched this movie again after many years tonight i had seen it before on vhs it is a dark moody piece and after watching it on dvd i would say if you have any intention to watch this movie watch it on dvd dont watch it on vhsthe darkness and moodiness are overpowering in vhs but in dvd the movie takes on a very different tone i think weir pushed the dark aspects intentionally for style but when the movie is converted to the lower color medium of vhs this goes over the edge dvd brings the movie to life again and i saw it differentlyanyway seeing it as if for the first time i realized that the treatment of magic is extremely good in this movie its difficult to go into all the reasons why i dont care to take the time to do sofor anybody whos curious anyway if you want to see what it is like in real life this movie is just very right on countless levelsand for anybody who isnt you really wasted a lot of time reading to this point
610,there are some wonderful things about this movie marion davies could act given the right property she is wonderful in comedic roles william haines could act and you can see why he was one of the screens most popular leading men until a potential scandal forced him from the businessthe story is a bit trite but handled so beautifully that you dont notice king vidors direction is one of the principle reasons for this the producer the boy genius irving thalbergits about movie making and you get to see the process as it was done in 1928 the cameras sets directors directing and actors emoting you get to see briefly some of the major stars of the day even charlie chaplin does a turn as himself seeking an autograph you also catch glimpses of eleanor boardman elinor glyn claire windsor king vidor and many others who are otherwise just names and old photographsplease even if youre not a fan of the silents take the time to catch this film when you can its really a terrific trip back in time
611,generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending the acting was spectacular and the characters didnt stray from their persons i especially liked the plot although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie however i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer extended maybe to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell for instance what happened to tristans brother hayden for all we know he died in the hospital maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing who knows maybe there will be a sequel maybe if there is i cant wait to see it
612,i just read the comments of tomreynolds2004 and feel i have to jump in here i understand he doesnt like the film but his reasons are not evident my feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness failure disappointment and sorrow each of these two people as portrayed have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire sentimental and sappy i really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances i have every reason to dislike jane fonda for her vietnam era actions but personal feelings apart she is fabulous in this role robert deniro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities this is the first i have seen deniro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and i really like it this film was a big surprise when i first viewed it and i look forward to seeing it again
613,hello everyone this is my first time posting and i just love the movie no child of mine and i could watch it over and over well i taped it a long time ago like a few years ago and i dropped it and broke it and i havent seen it in a few years could any one please tell me when it will come on again i would really appreciate it alotyou can email me if you want to cause that is my favorite movie of all including empty cradle to and if anyone knows when that comes on to please let me knowi would really appreciate it alot
614,a pretty average movie but a brave one from ms hawn to promote this vehicle as exec producer  as a starring vehicle although she ends up vindicated she is willing to portray herself as the dizzy bimbo how many other a listed actresses have subjected themselves to butt injury pratfalls since this movie not many does this mean the female butt cannot be funny goldie surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen persona  ventures in projects other wont sandra bullock occasionally goes therefor example miss congeniality but nicole kidman would never cop the pratfall a wonderful performer great to see some of my favorite actors chris sarandon  cliff deyoung notably
615,ive seen this film more than once now and theres always someone complaining about the obvious construction of the plot afterwards but then  this is part of petzolds game he plays along with the rules of genreits very nice how the highly improbable story of how the two girls timoteohummer meet is again mirrored in another even more improbable story that the girls make up for a casting this film is a journey between fact and fiction its more about potentials things that might have happened in the past or might be happening in the future than it is about actual ongoings its a reverie sorts of  so apt enough there are a lot of motives freud might have found interesting for his dream analysis like all the doppelgangerconstellations also i think gespenster might be interesting to be watched in comparison to current asian cinema of the uncanny petzolds everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an unobtrusive strangely familiar way this film is not about the obvious to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers or as the story of an orphaned mother who searches europe for her lost daughter clearly doesnt say much about the nature of gespenster at all
616,this motion picture has a steady haunting pace backed up with great acting one of chamberlains best performances and a story that is revealed to us over timebeyond that the music fully establishes the mood and assists in maintaining an uneasy cautious and somber toneweirs story is enhanced by using aboriginals their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominousalthough they are unrelated in story as well as genre this maintained the same feeling within me as ursula le guins lathe of heaven 1980 the last wave is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments remember hacking and slicing doesnt make a film a horror movie its the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all
617,ive always enjoyed films that depict life as it is life sometimes has boring patches no real plot and not necessarily a happy ending a river runs through it is the perfect name for this film and norman macleans novel life ebbs and flows like a river and it has its rough spots but it is a wonderful triprobert redford brings a lot to the film his narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly as a director he is restrained and calm and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes as for the acting craig sheffer and brad pitt work surprising well as brothers i dont know quite how to describe tom skerritt and brenda blethyns performances except that they truly feel real a river runs through it is a wonderful film86 out of 10
618,i reached the end of this and i was almost shouting no no no no it cannot end here there are too many unanswered questions the engagement of the dishwashers monas disappearance helmers comeuppance the zombie was little brother saved by his father and what about the head argh then i read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and i have to say i know it probably wouldnt be true to lars von triers vision but i would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned granted it would be hard to find someone to play helmer as the character deserves helmer the doctor you love to hate i think i have yet to see a more selfabsorbed oblivious selfrighteous character on screen but i could overlook a change in actorsi just have to know how it ends
619,i know i know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome i love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time i was impressed with darth vader turning against the emperor i really stayed astonished the anguishing sequence in that film was when luke is tortured and defeated by the emperordarth sidious he is about to be destroyed when darth vader dark lord of the sith eliminates his dark master a nice sacrifice the cinematography of this film is impressive i was surprised with all the vessels of the rebel battle ships and all imperial war ships and super star destroyers i loved the new race they brought on screen the mon calomari the ewoks the sullesteian landos co pilot and many more most of my favorite scenes are in that film1when vader destroys the emperor and is fatally wounded 2 when luke sees the spirits of obiwan and yoda and then it shows up anakin skywalker sebastian shawthe greatest scene in star wars 3 when leia slays jabba strangling the hutt crime lordi personally like the script and the battle of endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of star wars between darth vader vs luke skywalker on the death star postscript the scenes with leia in the slave bikini are memorable 910
620,audiard made here a very interesting movie it begins with the description of an almostdeaf young woman in its working universe as a secretary she is ignored frustrated rejected hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life  but the guy is just coming out from jail their both being rejected by the society reunites them progressively charactersdescription is profund goes into detailsboth start to help each other for she can read on lips which reveals itself to be very useful for himshe will progressively evolve far from what she was at firstits beautifully filmed the whole is very convincing even if it turns into a film noir at the end gesture is in particular beautifully observed in audiards filming emmanuelle devos should be nominated at the best actess cesar awards for her magistral play action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple etude de moeurs its actually surprisingly entertaining  810
621,episode two of season one is a delightful holiday tale of love betrayaland a homicidal escaped lunatic dressed as father christmasa woman mary ellentrainorhas just murdered her hubby on christmas eve for his life insurance what begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a deranged santa clause suit wearing psychopath larry drake perfectly over the top threatens her lifeas well as her precious young daughtersthis episode is warmly remembered by even those casually acquainted with the program by the waythis particular reviewer watches it every christmas on routine most notable for its escalating suspense and narrative twists and all through the houst is among tales from the crypts best
622,taking a break from his escapist run in the early 80s steven spielberg directed whoopi goldberg in an adaptation of alice walkers the color purple about about the desperate existence of an africanamerican woman in the 1930s watching goldberg play celie its incredible that this is the same woman who starred in movies like sister act this is the sort of movie that could easily be  no make that should be  part of the curriculum in black studies and womens studies theres one scene that may be the most magnificent editing job thats ever been on screen youll know it when you see it i cant believe that this didnt win a single oscar it may be spielbergs second best movie behind schindlers list maybe even tied with it also starring danny glover adolph caesar margaret avery oprah winfrey willard e pugh akosua busia and laurence fishburne
623,this started out to be a movie about the street culture of the bronx in new york what it accomplished was to give birth to a new culture and way of life for american youth what other movie has done this except rebel without a cause one of the most important movies of all time the elements are simple yet fascinating the story is timeless young people try to succeed against all odds yet the story is always believable and never depressing the characters are so realistic a city dweller would recognize them as neighbors the story is entertaining and comes to a satisfying ending buy this one for your permanent collection it is a piece of american history
624,this was a strong poirotsuchet television mystery selection the characters were vivid and wellacted the plot and the main settinga student hostel were excellent japp was nothing special but for me did not distract from story one significant point many poirot watchers dont recognize good acting or good characterization i also think they are rather harsh in their judgments of some of the poirot mysteries finally i have read few christie novelsnone in recent years and find it annoying that so many viewers are upset about changes from the novel please viewers consider what is presented to you on film not what you think should be there that said the poirot mysteries vary in quality but not as much as reviewers and raters would have you believe with the singular exception of the five little pigs which was fabulous in plot character and theme the longer poirot films are neither that good or that bad for the record i have seen all the longer poirotsuchet films finally films without lemon hastings andor japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence there presence however is either obtrusive almost always with japp or irrelevant with hastings lemon is in the middle
625,this was one of the best movies i have seen the movie relates to real life and how drugs can play a major part although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget i found it to be exhilarating to watchsome may not like the story and say the script is lacking direction however when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters there is no direction is life i feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptationsmost of the cast are newcomers to the industry however they all pulled it off very well everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriatelyi think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be spiraling out of control this movie might just scare them enough to change their ways
626,i only watched this because it starred josie lawrence who i knewfrom whose line is it anyway the wacky british improvisationalcomedy show i was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem it is uplifting touching andromantic without being sappy or sentimental the characters areall real people with real foibles fears and needs see it
627,im not much of an expert on acting or other movie details but this movie just hit me deep i dont think ill ever forget it one scene especially i think that anybody who has seen the film will know of which one i am speaking is imprinted on my braini also watched the similar movie lilja 4ever as referred to by a previous commentator it was also very moving but not quite as straight to the point and brutal if you are sensitive at all either will bring tears to your eyes but anjos do sol angels of the sun may stay with you foreverthis is very depressing subject matter but i think no i hope that the film succeeds in bringing more attention to itmore people need to see this film
628,why a stupid boring crappy overrated film series like star wars gets all the hype and a truly amazing film like this one goes completely unnoticed is beyond me this movie will really open your eyes to the dark disturbing sad and scary world we live inunlike the boring elephant this movie isnt one of those just a typical day until someome pulls the trigger movies this movie focuses more on what happens after the eventdeana played by the very hot and very talented erika christensen is a happy and healthy straighta student with great friends and a great life until she is injured on the day of the shooting by being shot in the head luckily she is not killed but is severely injured and has to be in the hospital for a while causing her to be in a lot of emotional pain in addition to the physicalmeanwhile alicia played by the also very gorgeous and talented busy phillips is a nasty coldhearted rebellious antisocial goth girl who doesnt have a single positive trait on her and she is unharmed when the shooting happens because it turns out she was friends with the shooter and knew he was going to do what he did which causes her to be brought into the police station and be asked some questions when she refuses to tell the cops if she knew the shooting was going to happen they constantly come by her house to try to convince her to say something and she still doesnt so the principal of the school makes her attend a funeral of one of the dead students and after she walks out on that the principal decides enough is enough and forces her to go visit deana in the hospital of course she refuses this too but the principal says that if alicia doesnt do this the cops are going to continue to try to get her to say something and so she actually goes to see herthe lonely traumatized and both physically and emotionally wounded deana is more than happy to have someone visit her but of course alicia is anything but happy to be seeing her deana attempts to give her a friendly welcome but of course alicia responds with nothing but harsh and hurtful comments and a harsh statement on how she is only here because she is being forced and has no intention of being friendly with her at all but sooner or later that intention will change and thats all ill say  this is truly one of the most moving movies ever as well as one of the most dark and disturbing actually i think i would tie this with american history x as equally disturbing and moving at the same timewarning watch this movie at your own risk it contains very graphic scenes and images excellent and criminally underappreciated movie i feel so ashamed that im pretty much the only one that knows about it
629,i came across an insomniacs nightmare while looking for offbeat independent films and glad to say it did not disappoint this crazy half hour ride had me wondering all the way through and the ending was excellent  one of those nooooo moments that really stays with you ive shown it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree hands down the little ghostie girl was very talented and i think her performance stole the show she creeped the heck out of me i can say that much nanavati did a great job putting this short together all the pieces just fell into place and you can tell that shes a great writer from what she did with this script so well written its undoubtedly the strongest part of the film the directing was great and the acting was enjoyable but the most important factor here is the strength of the screenplay good job to this girl i cant wait to see more
630,this is probably the best of all of the star wars movies the starting point of the movie was almost like episode ivspacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place where the seriousness of mobster jabba the hutt was getting even more serious he ordered luke to die in a basement pit by the bonecrushing teeth of bantha who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark lukes jedi powers eventually finish the monster off adding to the sneaky rescue of han solo who was frozen alive at the end of episode v jabba was very angry about this that luke was sentenced to die at the sarlacc pit outsidebut all of the star wars good guys especially r2d2 had other ideasand those other ideas fended off lukes execution in the end most of jabbas soldiers died and princess leia was able to use the force to fatally choke jabba to deathlike in episode iv the death star in episode vi makes its appearance as i analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the imperial fighters around the death star the star destroyer personnel i guessed sped up the arming of the main laser using the imperial fighters as a diversion the 2025 star destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the death star was fired in surprise once it fired the rebel fleets only hope was that the death stars deflector shield was going to be knocked out and this affected lando so much because he wanted to destroy the death star but he couldnt until the shield was taken out and it was taken out with landos increasing impatiencelike in episode v the imperial walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons killing at least one of the ewoksbut the ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them for instance chewbacca as well as another ewok was able to commandeer one of the walkers and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers and the other ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkersit is amazing what luke could do with his jedi powers on his light sabre like for instance the scene on endor where luke deflects incoming laser shots from a storm trooper speeder bike and using the sabre to knock out part of the bike or in a climax using the sabre to break off his own fathers arm during the final sabre fight with sith vaderyou probably know the ewoks celebration after the death star was blown complete with a short display of fireworks drumming on the spoils of victory eg storm trooper masks and luke finally meeting up with leia after lukes own nemesisdarth vader now dead is burned on a pyre the celebration include ewoks singing but i think lucas did not buy thateven with the strong respect of film composer john williamson the home movie version i think lucas himself wanted a different ending in addition to the celebration on endor he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the sith the ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece he probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the death stars destruction balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies
631,it is nice to see suraj barjatya back at what he is best ata story woven around a marriageit feels nice to have a movie in which there is no single scene which you would avoid watching with your family though the story is simple and does not contain any new elementsyou still like the moviebecause of the presentation performancesand actually the over all treatment hats off to suraj the movie is about the fact that engagement leads to love the depiction of the changes in the way of thinkingbehaving once you get engaged is excellent director has definitely given it much thought and actors have done it to perfectionthough the movie is slowyou dont mind itbecause you kind of get so much involved with the story that you just wanna continue watching the joy of this newly engaged couple as a typical rajshree stuff it has many sentimental scenes which are highly likely to make viewer burst into tearsspecially ladies but when you come out of the cinema hall you are very much satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth 
632,i have seen this movie a while back after ordering it for my friend who is a big dominic monaghan fan the movie itself was very interesting though it had its positive points which for me was the donnie darko kind of wtf factor after the movie had endedof course with positive also come negative points to me the young girl in the film was incredibly good and dominic monaghan did a good job as well unfortunately i dont have this opinion about daniel burke who played lonnie this might just be me and im not claiming to be a serious critic in the way that i dont find myself skilled enough but he just didnt seem convincing as an actor but perhaps its even more striking then for although i am not a critic this does get my attentionto conclude over all i think its definitely a film worth watching its interesting confusing and you just should have seen it
633,enchanting romantic innovative and funny the vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled exceeding better known death romances such as ghost while we know intuitively that peter and june will find ultimate happiness at the end of that longlong stairway the joy is in the journey the moral of the tale of course is timeless love conquers all but the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur with more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures the directors vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later far into the cgi erayet for all the cosmic scale powell and pressburger knew an essential truth the best story is told at the smallest level the wonderfully determinedly romantic aspect of stairway is captured with ultimate simplicity junes teardrop preserved on a rose petal this film like the story and the set itself is one for the ages
634,i was just a bit young for this one but i had to see it theres some excellent music which many folks have mentioned but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance by angel a now mostly ignored but once quite popular musical outfit wearing their trademark white outfits they grind through 20th century foxes and apparently all try to cram into the cameras field of vision keyboardist gregg giuffria remains the bands highlight and has apparently never gotten much of a haircut ever cherie currie exrunaways singer begins a brief but notable acting career here and is quite memorable alongside jodie foster and the rest her topless 3d scenes in parasite and her ufo sighting in wavelength kept us all watching her for a time its not a masterpiece but it preserves a chunk of its period for all to gaze upon and wonder
635,there are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like stardust did all throughout the course of the film as magically fairytalelike as the princess bride stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000s as well as the 1990s exciting hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters michelle pfeiffer and robert deniros especially i challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile from the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finishten stars and not a decimal less
636,i saw this movie on comedy central a few times this movie was pretty good its an interesting adventure with the life of sunny davis who is arranged to marry the king of ohtar so that the us can get an army base there to balance power in the middle east some good jokes including sunnygate i also just loved the ending theme it gave me great political spirit ten out of ten was my rating for this movie
637,ok so the musical pieces were poorly written and generally poorly sung though walken and marner particularly walken sounded pretty good and so they shattered the fourth wall at the end by having the king and his nobles sing about the battle with the ogre and praise the efforts of puss in boots when they by rights shouldnt have even known about itwho cares its christopher freakin walken doing a movie based on a fairy tale and he sings and dances his acting style fits the role very well as the devious mischievous puss who seems to get his master into deeper and deeper trouble but in fact has a plan hes thought about seven or eight moves in advance and if youve ever seen walken in any of his villainous roles you know the ogre bit the dust hard at the end when walken got him into his trapa fun film and a mustsee for anyone who enjoys the unique style of christopher walken
638,wasnt sure what to expect from this film i love watching brosnan in any movie hes always good but this was totally different hes a mess and plays being a mess very well in fact he reminded me of myself a few times back in uni  so yes theres not a lot of violence theres not a lot of action but the dialogue is cracking the acting is superb and very refreshing and its pretty funny too  i dont think youll come out of the cinema going wow i was blown away but youll come out smiling having enjoyed a good film cant ask for more than thatoh and if youre lucky some moron will put the adverts reel in wrong and youll get inverted upside down reversed with reversed audio adverts brilliant nothing like watching a jack daniels ad where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with a gruff american twin peaks commentary 
639,my children just happened to stop at this movie the other night and as things started to play out it really piqued my interest i had to head out for bowling league so i had them record it for me on the dvr so i could watch the rest later well i just got done watching it and the front of my shirt must be soaked after crying buckets it was an excellent movie even though i could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing and i never in a million years would have guessed the reason why alissia had gone from this beautiful girl to an antisocial goth this was probably why my shirt was soaked because ive experienced that same pain that alissia was feeling i too would not have sought out this movie but im sure glad i saw it very moving very touching great for those who love a good drama or tearjerker
640,return of the jedi is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right and that is a shame because the last chronological installment in the star wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling it manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale and does so very convincinglyyes there are ewoks  cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the star wars demographic  and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga where luke finally comes face to face with darth vader the most recognizable villain in movie historyreturn of the jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline which went from slightly implausible in the empire strikes back to very convincing here an exciting opening at jabbas palace a masterful performance of ian mcdiarmid as the emperor luke finally coming into his own the resolution of solo and leias romance and the extremely powerful final moments on the endor moonyes there are slight annoyances but they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers whove had time to nitpick every single scene its still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter its not a good movie  its fantastic
641,me and my sister saw the premiere last night it was so good we were glued for the whole thing hahahai think im hooked for the season they have some really good actors in this thing the head coach guy and the player that likes pete were very good and the plot has already got me but i dont really understand how theyll keep it stretched for a whole season there will probably be some big twist thoi cant wait till tuesday finally jeremy sumpter who is he i can tell hes going to be big he was soo good we fell in love with his character right away cant wait for the next episode go jeremyaimee
642,before dogma 95 when lars used movies as art not just a story a beautiful painting about love and death this is one of my favorite movies of all time the color the music just perfect
643,i had watched as much of the series as i could manage to watch on television but unfortunately started a job that got me working evenings i managed to catch some recordings of it at least and of course purchased the recently released dvd of the complete series watching the dvd you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first but they ironed out a fair number of the flaws after the pilot was done the voices are well suited to the characters and the writing is excellent its rather refreshing to see animation getting back to its roots by reintroducing adult themes thing is with the way society has come in the last century you need to be a bit more blatant about it by todays standards in order to be recognised as an adultoriented show the characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life its your typical sitcom in that regard but the humor is more like what youd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or saturday night live back when snl was actually funny good job dreamworks perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going and also improve the marketing of merchandise for the series to help defray its high costs its a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though hmm
644,the days is a typical family drama with a little catch  you must relate to the characters emotions in every way possible in order for you to truly appreciate the showpossible spoilers for those who are unfamiliar with the showthe story obviously for all the people who has watched the show is the world of cooper day the middle child of the family he records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his observations his family includes a mother a father a perfect sister and a geniuslittlebrother the first episode which is going to sound a bit stupid since john scott shepard has created this situation  both the sister and mother gets pregnant thats the first situation the writer hits then the father quits his job at the law firm the youngest son gets a panic attack the middle child gets in a fight with the sisters boyfriend this is all in a days workspoilersi admire this show i dont know its a bit crappy but i like it first i thought the camerawork was a ripoff but then i got used it and started to like it i liked the quiet conversations under a dark light i liked the intimate feeling of the show i liked the lowbudget style i liked the acting i admire the story then i find myself wanting a second season of the days i slowly became a fan of it as the 6episode airing on abc came to an end its a really good show and its nothing like the oc the two have nothing in common so i hope fans will stop comparing themand if you can relate to either abby jack natalie cooper or even nate youll like this show a lot
645,i noticed that a new hope and the empire strikes back are in the top 10 but that this one isnt even in the top 100this movie has a bad reputation because of ewoks but there are so many reasons to love this moviethe rescue of han solo from jabba this official wraps up the han solo in debt subplot that was established when we first met the character in a new hopethe emperor was finally revealled well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw the emperor as kidsthe speeder bike chase alright so this was a special effects moment but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the filmsthe 3 part climax 1 the battle of endor led by han and leia 2 luke confronts his father  the fall of the emperor 3 the destruction of the second death star landos momentthe final celebration with our heroes like i said this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think its kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the empire our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each otherall in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story
646,peaceful rancher robert sterling is on the losing side of a range war with his ruthless neighbors that is until notorious outlaw robert preston shows up out of the blue to level the playing field soon he begins to go too far feeding a growing sense of unease in sterling especially when his son begins to idolize the wily criminalthe sundowners is a tightlypaced gritty and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by preston here he comes across as an evil version of shane that is until the real nature of the rancher and the outlaws relationship is revealed most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surpriserounding out the cast is chill wills jack elam and the debut of john drew barrymore who became more famous for his offspring than his acting
647,well vivah is quite a good but typical sooraj barjatyas movie it shows different aspects of indian families wedding ceremonies etc the movie is more than good but not extremely goodthe big plus point of the movie is direction music and shahid and amritas acting especially the last scene the movie starts with a common factor of indian movie a girl being disliked by her stepmother story is the movie is a bit common but it is good good enough to make the movie a blockbusterminus point is common story of bollywood movie overall i would say it is two times must watch movie if you want to see typical indian family values and ofcourse love
648,second part actually episode 48 of the hit danish tvseries is slightly inferior to the first one but has plenty of laughs and scares as well this time udo kier plays two parts as the monster baby and his demonlike father other standout parts this time are søren pilmarks doctor krogshoj who must face the horrible revenge of dr helmer and once again patient mrs drusse tries to solve the mysteries miss marplestyle ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors ernst hugo järegård dr helmer and kirsten rolffes mrs drusse you wonder how theyre ever going to be able making part iii but i hope von trier will give it a shot sadly morten rotne leffers the downs syndrome dishwasher 2 died shortly after as well look for stellan skarsgård in a cameo 
649,this movie has everything a fantasy movie should have romance clever witticisms great acting and a fair dose of magic i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot based on the neil gaiman novel which i am now looking to read and colorful charactersone of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is unlike so many scifi fantasy movies out there right now which leave openendings and such this was a pure fairytale satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequeloriginal fun feelgood fantasy
650,the combination of reading the novella and viewing this film has inspired my wife and i to new levels recently i was pondering a statement made by the artist thomas kinkade in one of his inspirational books he states you and i were not designed to breathe the fetid air of five oclock traffic nor do i think god had banal television programs media hype worthless purchases and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe i hadnt seen a river runs through it in a couple of years but after pondering kinkades statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye i watched it and saw a whole new world to the film and it inspired me to read the book a must read i have always been frustrated in southern california but somehow got caught up in its materialistic society the film really puts into perspective of how we should really experience gods creations a combination of macleans story and my desire to move back to the northwest has driven me to move to montana i want my future kids to be able to rome the landscape go flyfishing with me ride horses into nothing but open land and serene lakes set in the mountainside a place where you seldom worry about crime i look around socal and all i see is shopping malls rude snarling people in their mercedez bens miles of vehicles on congested freeways gangs racial turmoil on the verge of violent eruption and everyone skeptical of each others intentionsanyway the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones there is a lot of deep thinking in this film the scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension you should finish this film relaxed yet full of insights to your own life it takes a compassionate intelligent and spiritual person to really grasp the meaning if you dont understand the art of cinema and how a director achieves his goals through dialogue tone light colour scenery camera anglesmovement etc then this film is probably not for the crowd that thinks the fast and the furious is the greatest film granted it was entertaining but shallowthe bottom line this film helps to realize that life is not about how much money you have or what things you posses rather it is about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together quality not qauntity
651,12 pierce brosnan greg kinnear hope davis adam scott philip baker hall directed by richard sheparda well formulated story and film all together brosnan has never been better in a film role outside of his bond movies after 2004s after the sunset his newest role brings in the laughs and a great time professional hitman so to speak julian noble on a job in mexico city winds up meeting the exact opposite of himself a high strung business man danny wright kinnear possibly one of his best roles also on business there the two onscreen duo produce a comically charged laugh riot and fail to not deliver the laughs davis in one of her best roles since american splendor gives another charming and witty performance one of the years most enjoyable and best films my final rating 910
652,i first saw this movie at a festival there were many good movies but few kept me thinking about it long after and an insomniacs nightmare was definitely one of them tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker the shots were great casting was perfect dominic shined in his role that she perfectly crafted there wasnt a lot to know about his character but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him and ellen i cant wait to see where she ends up shes showing a lot of talent and i hope she does a few more films with all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill tess shows that its all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors kudos to everyone involved with this film and thanks to tess and co for distributing it on dvd
653,and possibly closest to the dickens story line although i find the young ebenezer hard to watch whos idea was that period hair surely they could have done better than that scott does an incredible job as scrooge his delivery of some of the lines from dickens finally brought it to life for me edward woodward is everything we expect and more of the ghost of christmas present i find gc scotts scrooge much more of a believable miser than the more current version done by patrick stewart the scene christmas morning when scrooge realizes he hasnt missed it is enough to convince one that scott knows how to act versus overact hes phenomenal here nearly the entire cast is incredible the tiny tim in this version of the christmas carol is a little tough to look at almost too sweet still the music and the scenery make this a must watch every holiday enjoy
654,i have been a jodie foster fan ever since we were both kids from her disney years i loved her tomboy antics in films like candleshoefoxes was such a huge departure from all of thatwhere other young female actors of that era turned to sexual puerility disguised as comedy little darlings anyone jodie went for a depressing and tragic tale of teens dragged to their demise by the powerful allure of temptation and addictionthis was not disney this was not porkys this was not halloweed this was a dark  powerful story of the destruction of young lives sadly its a tale that still plays out on a daily basis all over the country this film could be replayed with a current soundtrack and still be wholly relevantits not the best film ever made it is tired at some parts not all the performances are particularly outstanding but jodie foster continued to show her chops as a real adult actor a trend started when she was very young in taxi driver7 out of 10 barky
655,this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still roll with it you have a insecure troubled and fascinating main character played by jeanpierre léaud who is trapped between two no three women we listen to his social philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues we see him working his magic around the three women that he loves this could be the premise for a fowl movie full of rigid cold uninteresting commentaries yet director jean eustache manages to keep it fresh ironic and witty being such a long movie one cannot but burst into laughing when after 2 hours of speaking politely jeanpierre léaud all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie this kind of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a commentary nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of françoise lebrun towards the end of the movie 3 and 12 hours and worthing every minute
656,busy phillips put in one hell of a performance both comedic and dramatic erika christensen was good but busy stole the show it was a nice touch after the smokers a movie starring busy which wasnt all that great if busy doesnt get a nomination of any kind for this film it would be a disaster forget mona lisa smile see home room
657,its amazing that actress pj soles didnt become a big star after playing riff randall 1 fan of the punk rock group the ramones in rock n roll high school soles is so exuberant you dont mind shes obviously too old to still be in high school that fact is leveled out by having all the kids look 24 the movie is a fastpaced frolic that doesnt copout everything gets blown to smithereens at the end and thats just as it should be mary woronov an innately kinky and funny presence as the nazilike principal gets a great oneofakind bit at the beginning where frisbees fly dangerously close to her head how many takes did they use on that or was it a fluke and dey young is very appealing as soles best kate rambeau the weakest link ironically enough in this high school chaingang is the ramones they cant act theyre not funny and their concert segment goes on too long one ramones song i want you around is treated as a fantasy and is well captured other incidental songs are good particularly a rare paul mccartney ballad heard near the beginning did we meet somewhere before great fun  from 
658,this is what i was expecting when star trek ds9 premiered not to slight ds9 that was a wonderful show in its own right however it never really gave the fans more of what they wanted enterprise is that show while having a similarity to the original trek it differs enough to be original in its own ways it makes the ideas of exploration exciting to us again and that was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved another ingredient to success was the relationships that evolved between the crew members viewers really cared deeply for the crew enterprise has much promise in this area as well the chemistry between bakula and blalock seems very promising while sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch i feel the tensions on enterprise can lead to much more and say alot more than is typical i think when we deal with such grand scale characters of different races or species even we get some very interesting ideas and television also we should note the performances blalock is very convincing as vulcan tpol and bacula really has a whimsy and strength of character that delivers a great performance the rest of the cast delivered good performances also my only gripes are as follows the theme its good its different but a little to light hearted for my liking we need something a little more grand doesnt have to be orchestral maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice and my one other complaint they sell too many adds they could fix this by selling less ads or making all shows two parters otherwise well end up seeing the shows final act getting wrapped up way too quickly as was one of my complaints of voyager
659,its so rare to find a film that provides a plot that cant be figured out at every turn surprises throughout delighting throughouta couple of things i could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays the good girl hard worker and yet in the end she ends up being an antisocial risk taker that was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pausethe other thing i could not get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film i never did get who he was or what his issues were if anyone has any ideas id like to hear what they might bethe film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing very much worth seeing
660,i was but a babe in arms when george lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world saga chronicling the adventures of young luke skywalker and the notorious darth vadar but even today 20 years on i can appreciate the genius that is lucas and the incredible imagination hes been blessed with in a new hope lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky princess leia the rougish han solo and the spirited luke skywalker as well as that best loved of villains the sinister darth vadar in the empire strikes back he went all out to show us special effects can add to a tale and managed to something noone thought you could do on screen he made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat return of the jedi is a fitting end to a saga that will stand the test of timewhen the empire srtikes back ended with encasing of the lovable rouge han solo in carbonite to be delivered to jabba the hut and young luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse vadar it seemed had won the day how we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow in lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from hans daring rescue from jabbas palace to the the final climactic battle on the death star between luke and vadar as luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his fathers soulold friends like the smooth talking lando calrissian and the ever lovable chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the emperor himself  played by the brilliant ian mcdiarmiudhow he missed out on an oscar is a mystery desperate to turn luke to the dark side even if it means betraying his apprentice darth vadarall in black with his red eyesghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed master of the events that unfold his new and improved death star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the empires reign for good lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted we watch in excitement as han and leia attempt to bring down the shield around the death star from the forest moon of endor with the help of some adorable ewoks  who i really do not believe take from the movie at all in fact i feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the death star and hindered by legions of stormtroopers and imperial officers we cheer on lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty imperial fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the deatn star to destroy it once and for all and we watch with bated breath as vadar and the emperor attempt to turn luke to the dark side while he in turn tries to turn his father backbut for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside darth vadar for rotj is a battle of emotions and feelings vadar is caught between his loyalty to the emporer and the empire and his fatherly inclinations to luke never did i think that a mask could show emotion but somehow one cant but see the confusion and pain on vadars face during the final scenes as the emporer turns on luke there is more depth and emotion to vadar than i believed a villain especially one more machine then man could have and that i think is what makes him so accessible he is conflicted the apprentice as much as the master the victim as much as the villain without ruining the end too much vadars final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogyso in conclusion what can i say george lucas is the master of the saga star wars is the most compelling and engaging sagas ive seen in a long time and i have yet to see another saga rival it return of the jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending lucas masterpiece deserves its action suspense romance tragedy redemption joy all rolled into one and its memorable characters wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that lucas can be proud of
661,maybe i loved this movie so much in part because ive been feeling down in the dumps and its such a lovely little fairytale whatever the reason i thought it was pitch perfect great intelligent story beautiful effects excellent acting especially de niro who is awesome this movie made me happier than ive been for a whileit is a very funny and clever movie the running joke of the kingdoms history of prince savagery and the aftermath the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled thats much of what makes it so good its an elaborate specialeffectsladen movie with more story than most fairytale movies yet there is an incredible attention to small thingsi feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again
662,what a fun movie if youre a giallo fan red queen kills 7 times is a real winner to begin with its hard to go wrong with barbara bouchet and marina malfatti in the same giallo both are wonderful  especially the wideeyed innocent bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life the kill scenes in red queen kills 7 times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy one of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start the killer the red queen is one of the most overthetop and interesting looking murderers ive seen in an italian movie the 70s sets and fashions are wonderful in fact all the visuals are interesting with the laughing red queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film the convoluted plot held my interest throughout finally bruno nicolais score may be the best ive heard from the composer the main theme is so memorable i havent been able to get it out of my head for two daysthe only two issues i have with red queen kills 7 times come in the films finale first the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot if youve seen more than a couple gialli you wont have any problem determining who is behind the killings second the ending feels a little too rushed and as a result is a bit confusing im definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me but ill admit to being at a loss to explain it all a second viewing might just clear this up
663,dont know how this missed award nominations great film certainly of the calibre of beautiful mind great acting photography script and drama i cant imagine anyone not being entranced by this film
664,one of the finest films ever made why it only got a 76 rating is a mystery this film is a window into the world of the black experience in america should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10 i recommend watching it with the long walk home as a companion piece if you think whoopi goldbergs work is about homer and eddie or hollywood squares think again dont miss this movie which should have won the oscar and read the book too
665,without doubt beat street is the best film about the breakin scene everything about it is spot onthe clothes pumathe music and most importantly the dancing the storyline is basicbut hey whats there to tell a story about the whole point of the film is to show what kids of that moment in time were doingwhat mattered to them it shows that teenagers in general are goodall that mattered to these everyday kids was musicdancing and friendship having watched the dvd recently i was plesantly surprised how well it had stood the test of time the clothes didnt look dated possibly because puma is now having a massive comebackthe music still sounds freshand the dancing is still captivating to watch a film anyone 1025 years of age should see as part of their youth culture
666,this movie is good its not the best of the great cg kung fu flicks but its pretty good first thing first the story is actually good the whole idea of gods vs fallen gods type deal with super powers is pretty cool my problem is theres too many characters it got very confusing when they switched scenes the special effects were incredible the fighting scenes were very fast paced and complex this movie practically all computer generated the acting is superb as always expected from such high profile players ekin cheng makes an excellent protagonist loner character zhang ziyi did nothing for me in this movie i thought she would have a bigger part but she did one fight scene and a whole lot of yapping the bad guy the whole skull army and the whole blood cloud thing is very frightening the music is also excellent to me this story deserve at least a miniseries and not just one movie theres too much story to cram in 2 hours maybe if there was a book or something i would be able to keep up with all the characters and the details this movie sacrifices story integrity for action i reccomend storm riders over this any day
667,though this movie is cheesiness at its best it is pulled off perfectly this movie without a doubt has to be considered a modern classic there are basically two kinds of movies i like  movies with depth chick flicks if you must  i blame my wife for this and mindless comedies where i can sit back and relax this movie is a perfect example of the lattera friend of mine turned me on to this movie shortly after its release considering me to somewhat shallow he said to me youve got to see this movie its just your type of movie foregoing the insult i started watching i know they mentioned the ramones a million times but when you actually see them i said hey it is the ramones my friend replied i dont know they were a real band i had my moment of glorythis movie though now somewhat dated is a must see for ramones fans  or anyone else for that matter
668,this game show lasted just one season but was intriguing to audiences because it required visual aptitude and a steady hand one false move would disqualify the contestant from winning the prize even though it was clear the contestant knew the correct answer it was always exciting as the contestant began drawing wondering if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest it was a lighthearted show but it was clear that the contestants were often times embarrassed from a silly mistake made unintentionally rarely seen the game show did not survive past one single season only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show as it proved to be quite unpopular even though game shows were making a big return to the tv screen after the scandals of the 1950s game shows but it was a unique concept for a game show and one that has as yet never been seen again
669,at first i wasnt sure if i wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so i looked it up on imdb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so i thought i would give it a try expecting a movie like elephantonce i got past the fact that i am supposed to dislike the alicia character played excellently by busy phillips i realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between alicia and deanna alicia is so mean to deanna played by erika christensen almost throughout the entire movie but we eventually find out that they despite being polar opposites they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting they share loneliness and to what extent is revealed as the film progressesive just got to say how much i loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it i couldnt even get through elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the columbine tragedy this movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic busy phillips acting is off the chain that is a good thing and i would love to see her progress into some more mature roles
670,i liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole susan sarandon is such a good actor that she made an interesting strong character out of mediocre writing the true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome
671,im a male not given to womens movies but this is really a well done special story i have no personal love for jane fonda as a person but she does one hell of a fine job while deniro is his usual superb self everything is so well done acting directing visuals settings photography casting if you can enjoy a story of real people and real love  this is a winner
672,thomas capano was not anne maries boss tom carper the governor was that is the reason the feds became involved he called clinton and asked him to get the feds involved in the case i lived outside of philadelphia at the time so the case was front page news every day i also read ann rules book and saw the city confidential segment on ae tom capano was a megalomanicsp an ubercontroller and a monster he claimed to love ann marie but all he wanted was someone that he could control when she wouldnt let him do that anymore he killed her the ultimate form of control i think its a waste of money that he is still alive
673,even though it has one of the standard revenge price plots this film is my favorite of vincent prices work gallico has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters likeability when you watch it you feel for him you feel his frustration the injustices against him and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance even though he frightens you a little with his original fury as the film goes on his character becomes tragic hes committed his murder but now he must kill to cover that up and again to cover that one up and again your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood even if the revenge story is of old the plot devices themselves are original gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways a shame this one isnt available for home veiwing
674,just imagine what school would have been like in a world like this the kids are one big gang who have really good taste in music and unite against bad headmasters and teachers rock n roll high school is taking place in that world its like a ramones record coming to life the characters are all as silly innocent and charming as the ramones songs and the music itself is of course fantastic high school comedies have really changed over the years if you compare a movie like american pie with this late 70s classic where no tasteless sex jokes are made at all since a remake is apparently in the works it can probably be expected that the charm of the original will get lost along the way and will get replaced by vulgar halffunny dick jokes as bill hicks used to call them however the main problem will be that the ramones cannot be replaced they were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even come close to taking their place so the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone as quirky and charming as it is gabbagabba hey
675,first of all riget is wonderful good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time nice combination of strange dogma style of telling the story together with good music and great actors but unfortunately theres no the end as for me its unacceptable i was thinking how it will be possible to continue the story without helmer and drusse and i have some idea i think lars should make riget iii a little bit different im sure that 3rd part without helmer wouldnt be the same so heres my suggestion mayble little bit stupid maybe not i know that lars likes to experiment so why not to make small experiment with riget3 i think the only solution here is to create puppetdriven animation like for example team america by trey parker or even computer 3d animation i know its not the same as real actors but in principle i believe it could work only this way its possible to make actors alive again for riget fans this shouldnt be so big difference  if the animation will be done in good way average watcher will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie the most important thing now is the story its completely understandable that its not possible to create riget 3 with the actors nowadays so why not to play with animation and look for the possibilities that it gives to you even marketing one great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation just dreamsi hope to see riget 3 someday or even to see just the script im curious how the story ends and as i expect everybody here dogreets slajps im not talking about the kingdom hospital by stephen king 
676,this is one of the best bollywood movies i have seen up until now family and friends feel the same way about it this movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time in my opinion we need more films or movies like this to keep the south asian culture alive shahid kapoor and amrita rao acted extremely well in this also their couple attracts a lot of people to the movies this is a must see movie its a family and romantic movie this movie is also from the makers of hum saath saath hain and hum apke hain kon this movie is their best right now the setting of the movie was beautiful which also is a huge attraction this movie is must see recommended to everyone
677,all the folks who sit here and say that this movies weak link is the ramones would probably say that amadeus was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist rock and roll high school was centered around the ramones how anyone can watch this and not get a kick out of joey ramone eating bean sprouts backstage in an attempt to keep him in performing condition is obviously a wet blanket square daddyo ms trogar exploding white mice the hall patrolsinstant classics nevermind the riff randell characterif you dont like the ramones then you dont know rock and roll and you dont deserve to watch a movie called rock and roll high school
678,this is the epitome of fairytale the villains are completely wicked and the heroes are refreshingly pure danes deniroand pfieffer are wonderful as well as the new actor who plays the role of tristan outstanding performances delightful magic funny and dramatic and a perfect fairytale ending make this film absolutely fabulous im not so sure all content is appropriate for younger children but for an older audience there are plenty of hilarious subtleties the previews do not do this movie justice my fiancé and i were quite skeptical but were so thrilled we had taken a chance on this movie that i can only hope to assure anyone on the fence about this movie to give it a try
679,the first thing i thought when i saw this films was it is not really a film at least it is not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word film it is entirely symbolic everything in it has a figurative meaning so if you are not used to express thing in a symbolic way you will find it strange if you are not acquainted with philosophy religion spiritual life you will think its just a fairytale and even a weird one chaotic for me the legend of zu is perfectly transparent and i do like it it tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness the fight that is as old as humanity and every one who is in search of the sens in this life is confronted with it the film is obviously made by buddhists i am not a buddhist my religion and the vision of the world and human is different but as far as we are all humans and have the same human nature we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other it is a really beautiful film and i which we had more films like this  films that have a meaning there are too many empty stories which are good only to make time pass more quickly
680,the last wave is far more than the sum of its parts its not merely a disaster film not simply an exploration into australian aboriginal spirituality and certainly more than a simple court drama writerdirector peter weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thoughtprovoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to picnic at hanging rock two years earlier that you will continue to remember years laterwhen lawyer david burton chamberlain is called to defend chris lee gulpilil over the death of an aboriginal for which he may or may not be directly responsible he finds himself not merely struggling to get the truth from lee but making sense of what he hears when it does come as with the aboriginal belief that there are two worlds  the everyday and the dreamtime the truth exists on two completely different levels with ramifications more disastrous than burton could ever have imaginedno doubt the reason why picnic at hanging rock is better remembered is because of its enduring mystery we are led along the same path but forced to find answers for ourselves in the last wave we can piece everything together by the end of the film however even with all the information we have to choose how much of it we want to believe because the film takes us beyond the borders of our normal realitieson the production side weir uses his budget to great effect progressively building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting to heavy rain to good use of sound the incidental music is unobtrusive never trying to be grandiose richard chamberlain manages to convey the bafflement the audience would doubtless feel as he tries to unravel the mystery david gulpilil excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds wanting to do the right thing but afraid because he already knows the endingput all these things together and you have a perfect example of why david weir is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on strongly recommended
681,i was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute it is brilliantly shot with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed the plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike she hires an assistant at work with her true intention being to find love hes an excon and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her in return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off the film transcends into a dark film noir with a couple of truly excellent scenes and an even better finale the real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading characters disability the use of sound keeps the tension consistent and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping thats for sure throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression youve got the makings of a great film its the sort of film hollywood really wants to make but just cant
682,stardust another guarded review originally written june 15 2007the marketing machine has only just begun for this one no site yet wth so i doubt most of you have heard about it in truth i hadnt either sort of when i got the posting i thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was transformers one of the movies i want to see when not working so i an enjoy it 100 as a mere mortal moviegoer turns out it wasnt transformers and i had been aware of it way back when as that neil gaiman movie what is it about well in short its a gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star any more than that and id be giving away plot info which is a a breach of contract and b spoiling your fun if you really want to know what its about go buy the book rumour has it gaiman might be something of a writernot knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile and for this one it certainly was this screening was special in that it included not just film critics but also exhibitors they rarely have a mixed screening and local scififantasy folks so you know the expected audience right i mean with this crowd and the title of stardust i knew what to expectoh how sweetly wrong i wasyes it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom but it was not lord of rings it was not even another lord of the rings wannabe ahem eragon it was much more intimate than all thatbut like lord of the rings it was the well humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities its surely a romantic tale but with generous splashes of humour and that humour is of the sort which is not slapstick shrekism its more along the lines of dramedy than comedy before i go on lets do this movie review thingacting is in the very least good its always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but i do believe there were significant superbly acted roles michelle pfieffer is not sadly one of those she plays a villain and she does the job nothing special rupert everett though he was a real jerk that is a great villain peter otoole is well peter frickin otoole  which is marvelous ricky gervais is perfectly cast and shows why robert de niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part when he wanted to deliver the goods though he did and charlie cox who as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy i aint never heard ofclaire danes claire danes claire danes ive always been of mixed opinion with her she can be great and then she can seem to miss the mark in this shes the former and she is quite literally the star of this film sure her accent stumbles here and there and yes shes not as good as she can be when cox isnt in the scene however  well see for yourselfspecial effects are muted yet accomplished and only significant where they should be best flying ship yet  sorry potter direction is lighthearted and flows nicely cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in new zealand all else is top bracketand now that thats donethe writing oh the writing neil you devil its hard in todays climate to do anything original and at first you begin to wonder a kingdom a dying king a boy out to prove his own worth witches ghosts a quest or three  whats new but gaimans story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart and though you suspect how its all going to turn out you begin to wonder in the third act and  if youre me  find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best in the end youll find this story this movie is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not fantastical and reali wish i could talk about septimus vs tristan but i wont ruin it for you for those who read the book rest assured its done properlythose i spoke to afterward had the same impression i did a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new withheld for this generation the blank gets filledin only after the movie is in wide release because well you might be expecting it youll know when you walk out anyway i sincerely hope stardust doesnt get lost among the tentpoles even if it does itll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone i knowforgot to add the withheld reveal im a few years late but  a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new the princess bride for this generation perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but im still confident that years form now there will be the same oh i love that movie response to this as there is now for the princess bride
683,surely one the french films of the decade so far a taut atmospheric thriller making full use of the lead characters hearing impediment to use sound in a way rarely explored in cinema emannuelle devos gives a truly stunning  multifaceted performance at times devious and manipulative at other times open and vulnerable another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offerings from france
684,this is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen the footage is extraordinary mesmerizing at times it also received an oscar for best photography and deservedly so i have many movies in my film collection and several more ive seen besides them and not many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this oneits unique and an overall great movie the cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters we follow their destinies with devotion and get very emotionally attached to them along the way we also learn things about ourselves and our lives i think much of this film for what it represent and how it present it i warmly recommend it
685,of all the breakdancing  hiphop films released between 1983 and 1986 the 1984 film beat street is unquestionably the best one the story follows a dj his younger breakdancing brother a graffiti artist and a wannabe showbiz promoter through one winter in which they try to break out of the ghetto using their street talent the acting isnt always up to par and the characters arent fully drawn out but they are more than compensated for by downtoearth dialogue a plausible story fantastic dancing sequences and a timeless hiphop sound track it should be noted this film was shot in the birthplace of breakdancing this aint new york this is the bronx and features appearances by the fathers of breakdancing dance troupe rock steady crew and rapper afrika bambaata rock steady crew provide the best scene in the film when they dominate a dance battle at the premiere breakdancing club of the early 80s the roxy a must see for hiphop lovers
686,when gundam0079 became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else this ova is kinda the opposite though therere only half a dozen episodes it isnt filled with action but emotional things the two main action sequences in this i believe are enough to satisfy me after seeing so many gundam series movies and ovas i was completely ready for a civilianesquire movie this movie did a fantastic job of that what makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people it made the zeons seem more human rather than the original movies where theyre depicted as the second rise of evil nazis most people that dont like anime that ive forced to watch this movie lol liked it so id recommend it to a lot of people just for the antiwar story if youre a gundam fan and havent seen this you shouldnt be reading this you should already be watching it right now
687,this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd  since my 33 rpm got lostand any cassettes i made are also long gonei am not even a big john denver fan but was very impressed with the music  which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin  esp little st nick   it also contained a few little known songs  original  even though it was done at the end of the 70s this show had a timeless feel to it hoping to find a copy soon 
688,a great movie rather challenging than really entertaining sadly no memorable quotes here but this ones my favorite alexandre if youre leaving someone that you have loved you have to say what im telling you now farewell im going but to disappear to hide like a criminal is ignoble didnt watch it with english subtitlesin my opinion this expresses it all there is so much tactics involved in the relationships between alexandre and the others and yet everyone longs for a little bit more truth however knowing the truth can hurt even more as alexandre experiences common interpretation is that the movie criticises the mere possibility of liberated love by depicting the unwanted implications on the people involved it does indeed show this in a convincing manner but i would appreciate it if the reasons had been treated a bit more in depth its not that liberated love is in itself doomed to failure but people especially men i think should work on themselves and try to overcome the ruling morals before and not through practicing liberated lovethat said the movies realistic though and really worthwhile watching
689,i loves this moviebecause it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved heath ledger and orlando bloom did a great job portraying ned and joe it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that the language is very mild and sometimes dont even know it is there this movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean that they are vicious killers i hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one there is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ned looked at also that that is how people remember themfrom their armor i hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as i have
690,one of the few best films of all time the change from black and white to colour for the heaven and earth sequences was directorial excellencethe plot is extremely clever the complete film leaves you overwhelmed by all of the human emotions and although a war film it doesnt discriminate i must have seen this film more times than any other and i never tire of it it is a film that makes you question your own mortality and beliefs on what happens after our demise
691,one of b and cmovie producer roger cormans greatest cult classics was the ramones vehicle originally designated for cheap trick rock n roll high school its just a simple technically dated story but would serve up extra doses of nostalgia humor considering these were the kind of things that made napoleon dynamite characters funnysee eaglebauers van about teenagers who love rock n rollstudents at vince lombardi high school are met with resistance by the evil principal miss evelyn togar played by cult classic favorite mary woronov who fears that rock n roll turns kids into uncontrollable amoral deviants and vows to make a rock n rollfree zone actually she intends to wipe out rock n roll for all students regardless of whether its at school and she has the cooperation of most of the adults who might make the plan successfulbut not if riff randell pj soles can help it a ramones fanatic she has written some songs including rock n roll high school that she wants to give to the ramones and in trying to do so is rebuffed by miss togar who does all she can to keep her from going to see the ramones play in town it culminates into an ultimate revolt between the obsolete funhating adults and the teenagers in an ending that is reminiscent of over the edge somewhat after the years of punk when the fame of garage rockers the ramones and others would mark another shift in music evolution it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous exaggerated wayit is mostly mild comedy but a great feelgood comedy nonetheless when youre in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you with jerry zucker of airplane fame and joe dante of gremlins fame both taking part in some of the directing you can get the idea for what kind of humor youre in for and not to mention expect to see dick miller even if only for a few minutes in the films finale the story mustve later inspired and was consequently updated by the mid90s comedy detroit rock city which some minor character changes in the vehicle for aged glam rockers kizzi would recommend passing on the corey feldman vehicle rock n roll high school forever released nearly a decade later the original is still the best
692,valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films the death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good marley shelton did great as the female lead much better than jennifer love hewitt in the i know films david boreanaz whom is the main reason i saw this movie had a pretty small role but he played it well the exception to the list of good actors is denise richards she was horrible in this the only scene i was glad to see her in was spoiler her death scene all in all its a good movie to watch you should definitely watch this before you watch scream or i know again
693,i was very surprised how much i enjoyed this film i thought it was funny sexy painful and warm andie macdowells performance was nuanced and vulnerable for once the director of a macdowell film did not make her beauty another character in the film the romance between kate and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life imelda stalinson who has been a mvp in so many british films does a great job in this there is some tragedy in this but i think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting clean direction and witty writingthe film quality is excellent and the music is good too though unavailable on sound track
694,the sunshine boys is one of my favorite feel good movies i first saw it when it as the christmas attraction at radio city music hall when it first came out and loved it ever since i ended up seeing it 6 times in the theaters and if it was playing today id go out to see it againnow a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads matthau was brilliant but had the misfortune of being nominated against jack nicholsons oscar winning performance of randall p macmurphy in one flew over the cuckoos nest burns did win though richard benjiman deserved at least to be nominated as well even the smallest roles were played to perfection like fritz feld auditioning for the potato chips commercial which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film the direction of the greatly underrated herbert ross ross who previously brought a two person play the owl and the pussycat to the screen and made a full movie out of it does it again he opens the plays out without making them look like a photographic stage play he fleashens out the story and the charactershere were 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play where ben clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special though there are dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes the sequence itself is totally new a few years ago i did see at the broadway revival of the play with jack klugman and tony randall which was wonderful but i think that ross and screenwriter playwright simon improved on it its just a wonderful film
695,great drama with all the areas covered except for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like pitts character interviewing the presidentor pitt getting murdered instead of just having it described to usscenes like those would have kept the audience awakecutting away some useless minutes could have made more room for more heartpounding scenes like thosethe dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see pitt here makes the film so worth watchingalsobig fans of fisingearly 20th century styles and montana will really like this as well
696,up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga which finally ended in 2005 i had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the longrunning series the varied action scenes and really different characters jabba the hut furry woodland creatures etc made this a particularly appealing movienone of the action ever focused too long in one spot either the last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laserduel between luke skywalker and darth vaderanother nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of infighting between two of the stars gone was the incessant bickering between carrie fisher and harrison ford finally everyone was on the same page it was nice to seein the end this was simply a wonderful adventure tale more than anything else
697,once again proving his amazing versatility john turturro plays the introspective russian chess genius preparing for a comeback tournament and forging an unlikely relationship with a gadabout fellow resident emily watson at a 1920s italian hotel they fall in loveto the horror of her socialmountaineering mother geraldine jamesa wonderful love story whose gloss of chess might make it appear cerebralbut in spite of its origins in a nabakov story it certainly is not the romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis hands downjohn turturro having appeared in barton fink o brotherwhere art thou the big lebowski proves that he is not dependant on coen bros films to assert his stature
698,i cant tell you all how much i love this movie i have read reviews that say that this move is too confusing or like swimming in drying concrete i say that these reviewers have no imagination for anyone who loves fantasy fiction this movie is for you if you ever loved playing dungeons  dragons this movie is for you especially if you got into the oriental adventures im just sorry that i did not get to see this movie on the big screen just more incentive to get my own big screen tv 
699,emily watsons natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character i have ever seen on a screen she is the queen of this film beyond all doubt or is she transmuted to the king the internecine weaving of the chess games and the families struggles for control power and victory is stunning just as the chess masters in the film do the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once but all weave into either major or minor patterns the period the costumes and imagery of early 20th century italys lake district is captured magnificently not a single square of space is wastedso many brilliant scenes abound i cannot recount them all i recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice possibly a week apart because you cant possibly capture all the poetry within a 64square yet multidimensional framework in one setting i did not read nabakovs book but to try an analogy of my own what i am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetryasgame movie barry levinsons the natural it totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of bernard malamuds fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely american well the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing russian and italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment the true story here is that games are zerosum there is a winner and a loser unless both contestants draw but in life and especially in the context of our immortal souls we are only limited by those constraints and lifes conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit pure love as personified by emily watsons natalia can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from itthis is a magnificent movie 1010
700,fascinating i approached i am curious yellow and its companion piece with great trepidation id read numerous reports on its widely touted controversy and explicit sex what i got wasnt this but a thoroughly thought provoking and engaging cinema experience unlike any other i sincerely believe that the majority of the commenter who felt the film was lame or boring approached the film as if it were pornography perhaps this is pornography assuming pornography is something intended to titillate the senses but it is intentionally unerotic lena the protagonist throws her all into her performance giving it a realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and enduring her breasts may be saggy her nipples unusually large her thighs fat and her face chubby but by the end of the film the audience comes to identify with her and accept her faults as human this touch gives her even more believability out necessity had the director cast a briget bardot bombshell the effect would have been nullified i cannot more highly recommend this thought provoking piece be prepared to invest much thought in this deliberately paced film the patient and unassuming viewer will be thoroughly rewarded in ways most other films could dream
701,i really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie this movie was not intended to be a deep thought movie which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be in fact it would appear that if any movie doesnt produce a life altering insight and a deep twisted mind boggling plot they would rate it a 1 or 2 dont trash a movie because you dont like the genre peoplethis movie was an actioncomedy flick and thats all it was intended to be and for an actioncomedy it was very well done i was actually rather surprised that i enjoyed it as much as i did having never really been a jamie foxx fan and having the overused plot that it hasthe plot was nothing spectacular using the typical criminal gets out of prison and is thrown into badguy plot while trying to clean up his act see blue streak hudson hawk 48 hours etc etc etc but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist now the bad guys are actually the good guys and the real bad guy is an ubergeekjamie foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character and didnt try to overdo the humor side of the filmif youre looking for a deep underlying plot such as in the matrix or a drama such as of mice and men then this movie isnt for you but if you enjoy the raw action excellent fastpaced filming and an occasional twist of humor tossed in this movie wont disappoint you i would normally have rated it about an 8 on the same level as the die hard trilogy but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it should be
702,in my humble opinion this movie did not receive the recognition it deserved robert redford lives near me here in provo utah at sundance i enjoy most of his work and this was my favorite im sorry that more people didnt appreciate it my grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen she gave it to me to read after we had seen the movie together the movie and book hit an emotional spot within my heart and i was weepy for several days after seeing the movie sometimes love isnt enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves we see this in our own family relationships yet our love and our families and their stories endure throughout generations of time the cinematography was perfect and breathtaking  i was awed by its beauty and how well it brought to life the words of the author of the book norman maclean but when i am alone in the half light of the canyon all existence seems to fade to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the big black foot river and a four count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise eventually all things merge into one and a river runs through it the river was cut by the worlds great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time on some of the rocks are timeless raindrops under the rocks are the words and some of the words are theirs i am haunted by waters these words taken from the book and spoken at the end of the movie by robert redford who is narrating as norman maclean are basically scripture in my opinion any possible flaws the movie may have are overshadowed by the beauty and grace of the story and the cinematography it was beautiful
703,new york has never looked so good and neither has anyone in this movie while the script is a bit lightweight you cant help but like this movie or any of the characters in it you almost wish people like this really existed the appeal of the actors are what really put it overjohn ritter colleen camp and the late dorothy stratten are particularly good go ahead and rent or buy this movie youll be glad you did
704,wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the spectator question what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary
705,i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i was so impressedeverything about it was superb the acting the characters the story a believable child who grew into brave always willing to help others his mum must be proud i could not take my eyes off this film for fear of missing something it is the prefect fabletale with morals cute and scary sprites and monsters but nevertheless heartwarming folk a child poked and bullied at school who becomes a hero picked to be a rider at the local village festival and a journey to the goblin mountain where he discovers the yokai who are amazing creations that brian froud would be proud of and the evil kato and his off sider who definitely needed a hug these evil people capture the yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted objects like motorbikes and other mechanical things and these meld into one horribly violent robotic monsters whose only job is to kill takashi a young boy is the one to become their saviour alongside a red mandragon a turtle man and a river princess as well as a cute little creature that if it had been america they could have turned it into a cuddly toy and sold it at all good toy stores the lines are good especially the dont try this at home kids and other gems that bring a smile to your lips suspend belief and watch this with a child or on your own and enjoy though i must admit that the end was a wee bit sad and not necessarily so cheers furdion
706,there are few films that leave me with the feeling that gregor jordans ned kelly film did initially i had heard only half hearted recommendations and decided to see it for myself since then i have acquired both the video and soundtrack and have to say that after several viewings i am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film it is also wonderful to see something australian i appreciate its down to earth quality that if you ask me is a rarity as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films this film proves that you dont necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point the cast was a bonus including a variety of well known and might i add good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters it is interesting to note that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what and how they only said so many lines however if any criticism is due it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded in reality these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in australian history for example on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much much more to the relationship between joe byrne and aaron sheritt and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film also overlooked was the fact that it was not only aaron sheritts efforts alone that provided the victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery yes this is their interpretation of the story and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention i feel that in this case this is the only limitation however i can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation it certainly inspired me to look more closely so watch it and decide for yourself you might not like it at all thats your opinion and thats fine maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an australian audience for me id call it a breath of fresh air
707,i rented this film in dvd form without knowing anything at all about it part of a winter marathon of watching a film every night after several awful american action adventure films ballistic daredevil cradle of life zhu warriors struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking the story is complete nonsense but i found the films sincerity good heartedness and complete lack of irony refreshing and the film looks spectacular sure the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by hollywood but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color composition and movement than realism and so many of the shots are breathtaking in one shot two of the superhuman characters stand on craggy spires of rock a huge moon rising before them the image perfectly balanced by the three elements in another a princesswarrior spires through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heatseeking missile and the colors explode from shot to shot used to express emotion rather than to represent realitythe characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters offering no great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply physically several of the actors are astonishingly beautiful they play their roles straight up without irony or guile and so are believablemost strange of all despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterizations i found myself very near tears at the end moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original goodhearted vision of the director
708,i picked this one up on a whim from the library and was very pleasantly surprised lots of tight expressionistic camera work an equally tight script and two superb actors all meld together to make one very fine piece of film not for the reptilian multiplex brain but rather the true aficionado of cinema if hollywood ever does get its grimy hands on it im sure it will ruin it a choice treat all the way around other posters here have more than amply sung its praises so i neednt bother duplicating their paeans just take their advice and mine and dont miss this gem call it what you like i call it two hours of entertainment wellspent read my lips dont miss it
709,this movie is a lot of fun the actors really make the movie go the distance though without giving away the plot i would describe it as a new princess bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time you get to see a whole different side to robert deniro in this movie worth the price of admission just for that all the elements are there from adventure to romance and well placed comedypeople of all ages will enjoy it my parents even did good special effects may be scary for the little ones good date movie great for some escapismdeserves an a hope it does well at the box office
710,liked stanley  iris very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting arrangement the absence of violence and sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie

712,as it was already put the best version ever of homers epic entirely shot in natural locations in the mediterranean the sea and the sky are strikingly blue the islands green and untouched the clothing is linen wool and fur the settings stony and bare everything is somewhat rugged and primitive a bit what you would find in cacoyannis or pasolini movies and it makes it all the more authentic although the story is based on myths and widely goes into supernatural it gives us a good idea of what life in the 10th century bc might have been likethe rhythm is somewhat slow and austere but the whole is so beautiful that you quickly get into it actually it is amazingly close to the original plot by homer if not to the text itself ulysses doesnt appear until the first hour the start being centered on his son looking after him then he suddenly appears lost in a storm lands on the island of the pheacians where the royal family takes good care of him his adventures are told in flashback as a narration to his hosts  the terrifying cyclop the magic world of circe the underworld the sirens etc he finally comes back to his homeland ithaca after 20 years and it all ends dramatically with the killing of the pretenders of his faithful spouse penelopeas a story the odyssey is an unparalleled metaphor of the struggles of a mans life the cast is brilliant and international here irene papas gives us a typical greek tragedy style performance as penelope but most amazing is the albanian actor bekim fehmiu as ulysses really good looking and totally convincing it seems the role was really made for him strange that he was never offered roles of this dimension afterwards also playing nausicaa is barbara bach as barbara gregorini later famous as the james bond girl in the spy who loved me and playing athena is michele breton who was otherwise noted in the strange movie called performance with mick jaggeras it was done 35 years ago the series was actually quite an innovation for its time as the first big european coproduction for tv italy france germany and yugoslavia i have seen this miniseries in 8 parts on french television as far back as 1974 i was a kid back then and although it was all in black and white it left a very vivid impression all my life long i wondered if i would ever get a chance to see it again as it was never shown on french tv later oni recently found a copy on dvd all in wonderful color through internet it is unfortunately only in italian with no subtitles although french and german versions existed back then i never heard there was any english version of this film as it is widely unknown in the anglo saxon world and its quite a shame if you ever get a chance to watch this you are not going to forget it everthere were not many versions of the odyssey before or after that the one by camerini in 1955 starring kirk douglas is a classic swordandsandal like the 10 commandments but not as impressive and very short for such a complex story the one in 1997 by konchalovsky is a meretricious hollywood movie based on special effects sometimes quite gory very poorly acted and grossly afar from homers story and atmosphere
713,these days spielbergs the color purple is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven oscars and winning zilch whats even more alarming is that spielberg himself wasnt even nominated for best director needless to say the filmmakers deserved more acclaim than they were accordedthe story concerns the trials and tribulations of celie johnson whoopi goldberg an africanamerican woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband the film spans several years and focuses mainly on celies relationships with the women around her its told from a decidedly female perspective but you neednt fear that its a saccharine chick flickthe story is an interesting one livened with humour at times although the central characters struggles are paramount some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the films end but i didnt mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyesthe film received three oscar nominations for acting whoopi goldberg best actress oprah winfrey best supporting actress and margaret avery best supporting actress i think that goldberg and winfrey were certainly deserving and danny glover was unaccountably stiffedas already mentioned spielberg didnt receive a best director nomination for his efforts such an omission beggars belief since spielbergs direction here is topnotch im not especially crazy about quincy joness score but its not below average by any meansin the end the story is a satisfying one welltold by a master filmmaker working from pulitzer prizewinning material give it a try and youll probably be as baffled as i am about how it could be so poorly treated on oscar night
714,jimmy stewart and anthony mann teamed to do some of the best westerns ever made and this is one of the bestthe real star of the film however is the spectacular canadian rockies that serve as a backdrop for the story some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of filmin all five of the westerns that stewart and mann did together the supporting roles were perfectly cast no exception here right down to parts that might only have a few lines the characters are firmly etched with those linesstewart is a cynical hardbitten loner in this film whose only real friend is his sidekick walter brennan its brennans death at the hands of the villains that makes him want to finally free the gold settlement from the bad guys and incidentally redeem himself in the processjohn mcintire is the head villain of the piece and he was an underappreciated actor with a vast range he could play delightful old codgers authority figures and in this case a particularly nasty and crafty villain one of the best westerns ever
715,i had no idea what this film was about or even knew that it existed until about 1 month ago when i stumbled upon when i was searching for other films that stared dominic monaghan i thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a none sleeper and what hisher mind may be going through in the hours that they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleepit was an interesting film and a good part was played by domi believe that even though this film you cannot buy anywhere well ive never seen it anywhere you must see it if you ever get the chance because it will really make you think about those people around us that cannot sleep and have to suffer night after night of not been able to sleep or only get about 1 hour of sleep every night so overall it was an interesting film of good substance
716,im tired of people judging films on their historical accuracy its a movie people the writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story there are a number of movies out there that arent entirely accurate with the historybraveheart wyatt earp gangs of new york geronimo an american legend the last of the mohicansall fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically if you want to see a few great actors do what they do best then i suggest you see this film and dont worry about the accuracy of the facts just enjoy the quality of the film the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time
717,while i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem i dont know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever rightthe story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting one of the girls is alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle thrown together by fate they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving oni just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks because wow what a performance by busy phillips and erkia christensen not to mention the rest of the cast my only complaint is that the dvd was sorely lacking in special features oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring but all in all a excellent movie
718,if you werent there then unfortunately this movie will be beyond compassion for you which as i say is a shame because although some of the acting is amateurish it is meant to be for realism lets face itin real life we dont say things in an exacting or perfect way even when we mean to in this sense it works this however does not apply to our known actors in this film notably jodie foster born a natural the fact that the other 3 girls are not accomplished only adds to the storyjodie plays the glue that struggles to keep their friendship close even with the obvious feeling of fatality meaning that no matter how close friends are eventually there are some people that just fade away no matter how you tryand therein is the core of the movie its not about partying its not about sexuality but about these 4 girls and their final time as still young girls before they have to go the world aloneif you have ever had a friendship like that in your life you will feel this movieit will mean a lot to you no matter what era it is set in or what era you grew up in we all knew these girls in school or at the very least knew of them we all knew the frustrated virgin half wanting to hold onto childhood and half wanting desperately to grow up and thinking that will do it for her we all knew the boycrazy one the fashion plate whose vanity hides her fear of the world her fear of acceptance we all knew the party girl the one they whispered about with tales of not only her sad home life but of her notorious exploits and we all knew the mother figure the one a little more real a little more grounded a little more sad because she knew what would happen maybe you were one of those girls maybe like me you had been each one at one time or anotherthis film really captures that fragile time in life when want needs pressures womanhood childhood the world and loneliness are all embodied in each females head each factor on the precipice which aspect do you hang on to what do you toss over the edge no matter how you may want to hold on and how painful is goodbye to everything youve known thats what this movie issteps into womanhood while clinging onto childhood and how damn tough it is to keep walking if you were there you knowand love this film as i do aching and tenderly done a fine piece of captured femininity
719,i can honestly say i never expected this movie to be good i do not like family films i am far from a fan of shahid kapoor the directors last movie mpkdh was complete stupidity and the music was very boring and bland but there was amrita rao who has become my favorite after main hoon na there was also seema biswas alok nath and anupam kher who are very talented so a few plus pointsi finally saw the movie and i was very impressed he brings us the young lovers of mpk with a pinch of the hahk wedding and we have a winner the story outline is similar to hahk light hearted in the beginning to serious mode at the end the director also made character that you could relate to the thing i did not like about hahk was that the characters were too eccentric the casting adds to its perfection shahid kapoor surprised me with a good performance this is a major improvement and most importantly he suits the role the best is easily amrita rao in fact this is her best performance her screen presence is so electrifying you are bound to love her performance sameer soni amrutha prakash anupam kher alok nath and seema biswas are terrifically cast not one actor feels out of place the songs were quite disappointing but they will sound better after watching them mujhe haq hai and do anjaane ajnabi are nice ballads milan abhi aada adhura hai is also nice in watching the songs arent colorful and dancey and they are more like ballads the exception is hamari shaadi mein which is bound to remind you of hssh and hahk so what was the flaw in the movie the movie gets quite slow and the ending is quite stretched but the movie is still goes at a good pace making it a perfect family film
720,normally i dont like series at all theyre all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fastthese series however are well played the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one the story will still be catching your mindthe episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital
721,as the celebration of christmas has evolved through the years whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other that has somehow slipped past one ebenezer scrooge merchant and money lender in 19th century londonas his nephew points out to his uncle he doesnt keep christmas in any way because scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug the humanity in scrooge was driven out long ago hes a hard case a whole lot like his 20th century counterpart mr potter of bedford falls new yorkbut as charles dickens told this tale redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit scrooge and show him howa christmas carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century great britain as oliver twist was the characters in this film are middle and lower class the cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in oliver twist but they are having to struggle to stay up there still love and happiness radiate their home no thanks to the guy bob cratchit works for like george bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much ebenezer scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old worldpatrick stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of scrooge but george c scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film the meanness of him but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change scott joins a fine tradition of people like reginald owen and alastair sim whove both done great interpretations of scroogeamong the supporting roles i particularly enjoyed david warner as bob cratchit and edward woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of christmas present according to imdb this is one of 32 versions of a christmas carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best
722,this movie is about development people growing and people fading people surprising and people disappointing it has it all and more there is hope frustration injustice justice love and hate it is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially whoopi goldberg in her debut rolethis movie made me feel very human and proud of it and i suggest that this movie should be mandatory each saturday in all prisons in the world  it touches your compassion rating 10 of 10ps i admit it i shed a tear of joy during the final scene
723,yes i have a copy of it on vhs uncut in great condition that i transfered to dvd and if anyone one wants to bring back the memories of a christmas classic please emil me at dmd2222verizonneti searched everywhere and i found nothing on this and i thought that i cant be the only one on this planet that has this classic on tape there has to be other people and if they do i fit in with them being that very very few that has this classic so i consider myself lucky and i have all of the muppets christmas except one that john denver did with the muppets again i thinks its called a smokey mountain holiday im not to sure but its close
724,if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to with conversation character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new better and different those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing directing and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england other days other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment made in 1992 with alfred molina joan plowright polly walker josie lawrence jim broadbent miranda richardson and michael kitchens in the major roles under the brush stroke direction of mike newell these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painters eye reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character and the viewer too an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us
725,updated from a previous comment the great and underrated marion davies shows her comedic stuff in this late 1928 silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines a bit player in crude comedies they appear together in cheap comedies until marion is discovered and becomes a big dramatic stara great lampoon on hollywood and its pretensions davies  haines are a wonderful team and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart john gilbert elinor glyn norma talmadge mae murray rod larocque leatrice joy dorothy sebastian estelle taylor louella parsons renee adoree aileen pringle and marion davies you have to see it are a hoot a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the stillmaligned marion davies dell henderson plays the father polly moran is a maid paul ralli is the slimy leading manshow people was said to have used the career of gloria swanson as its model i think mae murray is closer davies and swanson were friends but this films story does parallel the rise of swanson from onereel mack sennett comedies with charlie chaplin to star in cecil b demille films of the late teens and early 20sdavies and haines were huge mgm stars and friends odd that mgm never teamed them up in a talkie theyre great together a sweet romance and delightful spoof of early hollywood greta garbo and bebe daniels are mentioned but do not appear

727,nice character development in a pretty cool milieu being a male im probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start it isnt as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters each has their own thing that they contend with once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion what i enjoyed about this movie is that it didnt go for cheap comedy when it could have it didnt try to pound a lesson into us the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people
728,i didnt expect to like this film as much as i did i got it simply because i saw it on the list of top 25 most controversial films of all time it didnt look particularly great i was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most cleverly composed films of recent memoryits about a twentyyearold woman wants to know everything she stores every bit of information she collects in an enormous archive she experiments with experience in sex political activism and human relationships meanwhile films crew is shown making the film and we view their reactions to the story and each other nudity explicit sex and controversial politics kept this film from being shown in the us while its seizure by customs was appealed the film is a narrative yet its a documentary that shows us the behindthe scenes world of the filmmakers during the narrative the fourth wall being broken this film is the most direct possible way of making a movie i have ever seen the movie predominantly works as a time capsule of 1960s psychedelic goingson freedomfighting and sexual liberation i like to think of it as much more than thati didnt think i would want to waste my time with the blue version of this movie but i actually really do this film is a buried treasure give it a try
729,i have seen all the films directed by robert redford and appreciated his love of the american people and the land in a river runs through it redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high rocky mountains of montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of thomas moran or albert bierstadt this film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author norman maclean and stunning camera work by phillippe rousselot serpents kiss reigne margotredfords cast is perfect tom skerritt is the rev maclean a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the bible brenda blythen the mother and his sons craig schaffer and brad pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons and later complex young men both schaffer and pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever it is the relationships between men father and sons brothers and their women to the outside world that grounds a river runs through it to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of hollywood films produced in recent yearswhat makes these relationships special however is the attention redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue this is a literate script beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning montana rivers and mountains the words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material while the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story it is not so implausible in redfords directorial hands given the material redfords ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again
730,this work is striking in its accurate depiction of teenage life at the time of its execution though this is a broad generalization parents of that time were too selfabsorbed to be real parents and those who were home tended to be far too distracted from the real issues where their children were concerned this film teaches us how to let go even when it is painful and does so with a sweet melancholy but informed style whereby foster talks philosophically about feeling the pain of life i loved that scene it was my favorite scene in the movie actuallythe transition from funeral to wedding was meant to show that life does go on and so must we baios skateboarding through a pack of goons and outrunning them was meant to show us that the troubled times will pass and we are meant to get through them to better timesthe whole metaphor of moving on and the procession of life is present throughout the film and serves to give us hope in the endi like this movie though i do not watch it often as it tends to make me melancholyit shouldnt be viewed by young children and probably only those raised in the 1970s80s would want toit rates a 7410 fromthe fiend 
731,put yourself into carlas shoes she is an overworked unappreciated administrative drudge who is invisible you know her shes trained three of her last three bosses knows where all of the bodies are buried and might even look back at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth always having time for another thankless task and does it better than most despite a serious disability she has the desk on the way to the restroom that becomes the repository of halffinished cups of coffee begging to be spilled what you dont want to hear it well she cant and neither can you until your hearing aid is in place prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing impairedcarla emmanuelle devos needs a change in her life work is leading nowhere friends are relying on her to meet their domestic needs and the only way out starts with a collapse that goes virtually unnoticed she wont take a vacation  a contract is going critical  so the only alternative is to hire an assistant carla submits requirements that convey her real needs a wellgroomed man this brings an applicant for approval that reminds us that we should be careful with our wishes paul vincent cassell does everything wrong from the start of his job interview and his getting hired clearly demonstrates carlas interest in his nonjobrelated qualities she sees potential in this former thief and as the story unfolds their relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of codependence paul has a difficult transition returning to the world outside of prison walls and finds himself in another sort of prison one of the office variety and another of indentured servitude to pay off an old debt his skills as a thief help carla win a political battle in the office but paul sees a grander opportunity with carlas skill in lip reading and draws her even further into a world of intriguethis is a brutal film noir unrated and probably suitable for older teens carla grows more powerful professionally as well as personally as the story progresses and her disability gives her clear advantages over the rest of us she grows as a woman discovering her sensual side while she uses her resources to overcome the obstacles of competing in a mans worldthe two main characters are meant for each other in a strange way without paul carla will remain in her role of a doormat she has our sympathy hopes and best wishes even if she doesnt make the best decisions along the way you will hear the world through carlas ears from awkward adjustments of your hearing aid muffled sounds all but inaudible without it to relatively distinct voices when you can see whos talking with one major sense disabled we see carlas heightened intuitive power to compensate and we can all use that sense to hear not only what people say but also what they really mean
732,its all about mitzi i loved her in this and didnt she look fantastic i love these lifetime sunday afternoon popcorn movies this is like one of those nailbiters where they always go to commercial at the most annoying times the richard character was completely creepy ive dated guys like that well not totally like that lol i wish zack hadnt have gotten killed he was a cutie and very easy on the eyes i love these stalker type stories it always makes me get up and make sure my doors are locked my husband doesnt usually like these types of movies but actually sat through the entire thing with me and actually enjoyed it i cant wait to see what mitzi does next
733,an ok movie about downs syndrome a mother has twins one is very sick the other is good but he has downs the mother does not think she can raise him so she gives him to some people who have 15 kids 11 have downs the mom does not like this  she thinks he should be with his family  i agree too  so they take it to court  the family gets broken up  the grandparents lose it never really says if the mom  daughter makeup i think this movies good but the plot is familiar its still good  has a few unintentional laughs
734,this academy award winning short film can rank among the greatest of the genre told completely without dialogue it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open after a while a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl the fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited as the cat comes very near to the bowl the fish jumps out the cat catches the fish drops him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy not knowing what has happened gets back this was amazingly filmed with real animals how cousteau got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable i only wish this film were available now for people to see i only saw it once in 1959 when it was originally released but it has remained unforgettable
735,with various bogdanoviches and gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew they all laughed is very much a family affairif you add the fact that bgazzara and miss ahepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary considerationif this all smacks of smug in  joke self gratification you will be pleased to hear that mr bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent i love ny paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late miss hepburn make no mistake this is her picturemr gazzara concedes it to her most self  effacingly in all their scenes together the plot  a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients affairs  is of minimal importanceit is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie mr bogdanovichs triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actorsfrom targets onwardsthere is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipmentmiss hepburn in particular benefits from this love extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directorsprincipally who the hells in it recently remaindered in uk bookstores the soundtrack to they all laughed varies from louis armstrongs 1947 new york town hall concert to sinatra to country to latinas eclectic as the city it portrays mr bs golden boy image was sure to tarnishfor such is the nature of the movie businessbut it is equally sure one day to be restoredand when that day comes they all laughed will be recognised for the fine work that it is
736,this movie is the best horror movie barnonei love how stanley just dumps the women into the lakei have been a fan of judd nelsons work for many years and he blew me away its a blend of horror and drama and romance not so much comedy his evil yet charming look captured me right then and there that look in his eyes i will never forget theres something about him i cant describe
737,i first saw this movie back in the early 90s when it was first released room with a view was also newly out enchanted april had so much more to offer i found it much more real and earthy the characters more believable for being normal by the end of the film i felt the same as i did when i first saw the bbc production of pride and prejudice i was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation peace liberty or love you get a sense throughout that italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known that they are so decadent for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is humdrum and constricting but in the heat of the spring in april everyones lives loosen and unravel in line with the victorian corsets and are slowly rebuilt to everyones satisfaction what a little gem of a film how come it isnt more well known

739,the matador is a witty dark humored and suspenseful melodrama that rises way above mediocrity thanks to two very engaging and earnest performances from pierce brosnan who has never ever been better than here and the always reliable greg kinnear who has his best role here since playing jack nicholsons gay neighbor in as good as it gets a big plus goes to the writing as well clever and occasionally very nasty dialog is delivered with gusto by brosnan and the slow building friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing all the way the story takes a few unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where its gonna go nextnice artistic touches from the director such as good use of music clever editing and somewhat unorthodox cinematography at times set a nice tone for the film and for a long period of time you dont quite know how to label the film but thats also thanks to a very well written script which keeps the viewer me anyway on the edge of his seat
740,actually goldie hawn is from washington takoma park maryland but i digress this is sort of a mr smith goes to washington type of movie with some variations but the same premise i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn the story is interesting but its highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shots life it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous i had to laugh possible spoiler ahead it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up and the speech she made at the endbeautiful too bad not many people have guts like that in real life
741,im sure that most people already know the storythe miserly ebenezer scrooge gets a visit from three spirits the ghosts of christmas past present and yet to come who highlight parts of his life in the hopes of saving his soul and changing his ways dickens classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favoritewhile i grew up watching the 1951 version starring alastair sims and i believe that he is the definitive scrooge i have been impressed with this version which was released when i was in high school george c scott plays a convincing and mean ebenezer scrooge and the actors playing the ghosts are rather frightening and menacing david warner is a good bob cratchit as wellthis version is beautifully filmed and uses more modern filming styles for the 1980s which make it more palatable for my children than the 1951 black and white versionthis is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that i watch almost every year at some point in the christmas season
742,maybe i identify with this film cause i live in nyc and suffer from bad insomnia but whatever it is i must praise the filmmaker on a most amazing job to do what she did with no budgetwow thats all i can say really really good like no money was spent on this film and it still blew me away i definitley suggest checking it out if you can great directing fantastic score and of course a script that will knock you on your arse see it
743,this is paul f ryans first and only fulllength feature he hasnt done anything since however he managed to get an amazing ensemble cast to portray the characters of his story i dont know when or why the idea emerged in his head but ryan wrote a screenplay which later became his own directed movie home roombusy philipps carries the movie on her shoulders as alicia a troubled girl the ones we always see in television series with dark hair and black clothes a package of cigarettes in the pocket weird look and disturbing eyes with makeup of course an event has occurred at her school a shooting some students have died and she saw everything now detective martin van zandt victor garber is investigating the case and as expected alicia is a suspect but the shooting is just the genesis the movie is not about the shootinglying in bed in a hospital room is deanna cartwright erika christensen she is one of the survivors of the hospital the script establishes a bond between them by the school principal james pickens jr he is helping all the students to recover from the event but alicia doesnt seem to care shes isolated so the principal punishes her she needs to visit deanna every day until five o clock then the movie startsi cant even describe how wonderfully written i think the movie is i can identify with the characters and the situations they live i like reality these things could happen to anyone and the things they say are totally understandable theyre growing up and trying to deal with things they havent experienced theyre doing their best without knowing it alicia when she visits deanna for the first time and deanna when she sees alicia standing in front of her are commencing a journey of that will define their personalities and ideas for the next step in life after high schoolthe director leads christensen and philipps through their roles very well look the contrast between them deanna seems naive and with plain thoughts no complexity inside of her mind when alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers she asks who has brought them many people deanna answers although some days later we learn theyre from her parents who come every week the parental figures are all well represented but are not as important as their sons characters deanna is lonely alicia seems mature and violent smoking cigarettes and talking roughly but after two days of visiting she finds herself coming back to the hospital every day even sleeping in deannas room all night when they both have a fight afterwards i believe deanna says why do you keep coming back alicia is lonely toothe ending of the movie without ruining it comes a bit disappointing its something i wasnt waiting for it eliminates some of the strength the movie has the revelation comes totally unnecessary ruining the logical climax the movie could have had it was an excellent script anyway and an excellent direction a damn fine moviewhen it comes to erika christensen this was the role she needed to fly higher her role in traffic was impressing but this was the big step the main role maybe not many had the chance to see her in this film and thats a pity she hasnt made one false move since then she has even come out with good performances in awful movies on the other hand busy philipps who proved to be very promising in this movie what a transformation hasnt got many opportunities for other rolesthe same i say about paul f ryan in directing of curse and i expect he is sitting now in his computer finishing his new script im waiting for his next movie im hoping the best for all of them
744,this may not be a memorable classic but it is a touching romance with an important theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skillthe story revolves around iris a widow who becomes acquainted with a fellow employee at her factory job an illiterate cafeteria worker named stanley iris discovers that stanley is unable to read and after he loses his job she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen of course as you might predict the two although initially wary of involvement develop feelings for each otherjane fonda competently plays iris a woman with problems of her own coping with a job lacking prospects two teenage children one pregnant an unemployed sister and her abusive husband however robert deniro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful but illiterate stanley bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect they arent your typical charming young yuppie couple as generally depicted in on screen romances but an ordinary working class middle aged pair with pretty down to earth strugglesi wont give the ending away but its a lovely heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy albeit from the perspective of a fictional character
745,the fourth of five westerns anthony mann did with james stewart this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named jeff webster who takes a cattle drive from wyoming to alaska via seattle he hooks up in seattle with his partners ben tatum walter brennan and rube morris jay c flippen that he has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip northbut first he has to put up with insubordinate trail hands cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy manipulative ronda castle ruth roman who believes jeff could be a valuable ally in the future thats why she hides him out on the boat while the captains looking for him for the earlier and justifiable killing of a trail handjeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy judge gannon john mcintire who runs the town of skagway alaska gannon locks jeff up for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle through town he fines jeff the ownership of his cattle and jeff just has to eat crow for the time being in the meantime jeff agrees to ride point for ronda up to dawson in order to deliver supplies but this is just a ruse so jeff ben and rube can slip back into skagway and steal his cattle back of course judge gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by jeff with a rifle while ben races the cattle over the canadian border out of gannons reachafter avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other skagway men they finally reach dawson where jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder which just happens to be ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in dawson jeff then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts panning for gold but then judge gannon comes up to dawson to get in on the gold action up there and tells jeff that he was getting a little bored with skagway and wants to try his luck up in the klondike himself that involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miners claims jeff and ben now feel its time to clear out while the goings are good leaving rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against gannon and his gangthey look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by gannons men because ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth ben is killed and jeff is severely wounded but that doesnt save judge gannon from his just due the ending shootout at night on the muddy dawson street pretty much takes care of that first jeff kills two of gannons best gunman jack elam and robert wilkie then as ronda comes out to warn jeff that gannon is trying to slip around behind him gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in jeffs arms then jeff kills gannon as hes hiding under a wooden sidewalk revenge has spokenthis is another riproaring western thats right up there with the naked spur and the man from laramie why the universal dvd uses a panandscan print instead of the widescreen print tcm uses is beyond me youll wind up missing half the glorious alberta cinematography by william daniels so if you like wellwritten 50s westerns then this ones an alist keeper 8 out of 10
746,suraj barjatya is best in movies on marriage and here he is back to his basics on vivaah as the story goes this is a story from engagement to marriage a movie you can watch with your entire family around you a movie you will hate watching alone the story is simple but the music is good cinematography is excellent direction is best everything about the movie has a class of its own there are a lot of scenes which will make you cry and am sure if you are watching the movie with your sweetheart you both are definitely going to hold each others hand till the end of the movieshahid  amrita jodi has given us hit movies earlier like ishq vishq  shikhar though shikhar was a good movie it wasnt accepted well by the publica truly shahid  amrita film
747,no there is another because every star wars fan had to have an opinion about i ii  iii and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy i will state the good points of the return of the jedi and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel of course i loved the music the special effects the two droids but this has been overly debated elsewherewhat we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie   a strong ecological concern  antimilitarist positions  fascinating insights about the jedi order and the force  cute creatures  harrison fords smile  a killer scene  near the ending when vader looks alternatively at his son and at the emperor the lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his black helmet and when he grabs and betrays his master to save luke thereby risking his own life  oh boy what is wrong in the prequel inmho   the whole human factor element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing  the force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults than about wisdom  too many jedis at once and too many light sabers on the screen  the lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot by the way if you enjoy the theory of the force as explained by obi web obi wen i mean and yoda then you should read a few books about buddhism and the forms it took in ancient japanthe magic of star wars imho lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice from a father to his son albeit the difficulties de mon âme à ton âme from my soul to yours as would write bejard to the late zen master t deshimaru
748,rock n roll high school will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate rebellious party flick portraying a bunch of high school students using the ramones music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic principal mary woronov of eating raoul fame the whole movie is a mile a minute its basically a big excuse to have fun and im sure that you will bullied freshmen check a dorky music teacher paul bartel also from eating raoul check exploding mice checkmateanyway this is the sort of stuff that makes life worth living even for someone like me who doesnt know the ramones music its pure pleasure with roger corman executive producing and joe dante codirecting how could we expect anything less too bad that director allan arkush later degenerated into fare such as caddyshack iialso starring pj soles vincent van patten clint howard dey young dick miller who has appeared in every one of joe dantes movies and many of roger cormans don steele and of course the ramones a real treatit seems like bartel and woronov always costarred they also costarred in joe dantes hollywood boulevard and the slasher flick chopping mall also starring dick millerin which they reprised their roles from eating raoul
749,cowboys james stewart and walter brennan take their herd from seattle to alaska and on into canada to stake a claim once there they have to contend with seductive shifty businesswoman ruth roman and icecold happygolucky villain james mcintirejohn wayne may get talked about more but his good pal stewart made some excellent hardedged westerns too some with the great director anthony mann frankly id take this with its sturdy action sequences and fine melodrama over north to alaska any daythe far country features some breathtaking scenery and cinematography that should definitely have been shot in widescreenalso theres some strong support by the always reliable brennan roman whos great the incredibly cute corrine calvet and james mcintire who plays one of my favorite types of bad guy the kind that doesnt take himself too seriouslythis would make a great doublebill with another highly recommended mannstewart northwestset western bend of the river
750,i contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creatingapproving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered no one i know wanted to see this movie based on the previews and everyone who actually saw it that i know absolutely loved it the advertising campaign is disgracedisasterblunderopened at 4 behind1rush hour which i have not seen average imdb score of 742the bourn ultimatum which i have seen awesome movie but 3rd week out average imdb score of 87 deserving i would say3the simpsons movie which i have seen okay movie but 4th week out average imdb score of 81 a bit high in my opinion4stardust average imdb score of 84 lower then bourn but thats been our for 3 weekswhether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising i think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time this should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasyfairytale and not advertised as just another fairytale too bad  anyway now that i have very pointlessly ranted onandon awesome movie go see it
751,they all laughed is one of those little movies i am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary it is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past but seems more contemporary even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesnt date it too much bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet that reality never brings it crashing down to earth but that said this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going and tal is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale it is a movie that wouldnt linger so long in the memory if it werent for the little moments provided by the excellent cast colleen camps simultaneously shouting orders at john ritter and her dog blaine novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat and especially the moment dorothy stratten falls for john ritter and says howweird its such a piece of fluff one doesnt want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on ones face
752,i had not seen this movie since the late 80s and decided to pick up the vhs version of it the plot is very slow and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick the music hip hopfreestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special the breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in breakin but i have to say that breakin 12 carry the energy  excitement to the screen a lot better its a movie i will keep in my library but its not a movie that i can watch over  over again just once in a blue moon
753,a critical and financial flop when first release the critics have turned around and stated that this film ison of the directors best a la ronde like feel to the film quickly develops as the guys from a detective agency ben gazzara john ritter and blaine novak persue fall in and out of love with some of the most quirky and beautiful women seen on film audrey hepburn colleen camp dorothy stratten and patti hansen much of the script was adlibbed or rewritten on the day of shooting which gives the film a breezy feel ben gazzara is excellent as the head detective persuing audrey hepburn after dropping singer colleen camp and seeing cabdriver patti hansen on the side john ritter ineptly follows dorothy stratten and immediately falls in love with her blaine novak has a few girls he is chasing including joyce hyser and elizabeth pena this film has some great performances by a supurb cast standouts are audrey hepburn she doesnt have a line in the first half of the film ben gazzara has never been better and an inspiring choice for a romantic lead and colleen camp has one of her best roles as the manic country singer christy miller she is a delight to watch as she fires off her lines in a ratatattat delivery highly recommended  stars
754,this movie is so wonderful its hard to find words to describe it this is the only time i cant decide which was better the book or the moviewhoopi goldberg is awesome and oprah winfrey such a good actress she could be funny happy and miserable all at the same time all together the movie was well directed by steven speilberg and should not be passed up 910
755,love is overwhelming in all its manifestations gorgeous absolutely gorgeous tudor chirila maria popistasu and ioana barbu one truly dramatic story about love in all its shapes a story about the undecipherable ways of young hearts about life and lost innocence all directed by the skillful eye of tudor giurgiu with a magnificent soundtrack featuring faultline  chris martin and vama veche it surprises in every way leaving behind the sour taste of misunderstanding love truly remarkable is it me or is romanian cinematography slowly but surely advancing and gaining respect this is a brilliant film two thumbs up to everybody involved
756,i absolutely loved this movie i bought it as soon as i could find a copy of it this movie had so much emotion and felt so real i could really sympathize with the characters every time i watch it the ending makes me cry i can really identify with busy phillips character and how i would feel if the same thing had happened to mei think that all high schools should show this movie maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing i recommend this movie to everybody and anybody especially those who have been affected by any school shootingit truly is one of the greatest movies of all time
757,an old vaudeville team of willy clark walter matthau and al lewis george burns were one of the best known but they broke up hating each other over 20 years later they agree to get together for a tv specialbut find out they still hate each other willys nephewagent richard benjamin tries to get them to work togethera big hit in its day and it won george burns an oscar for best supporting actor i somewhat liked it it was written by neil simon so its nonstop oneliners some of it was funny but making jokes of willy and als senility was not also i never liked matthau i never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly all that aside this was fun burns is just great tossing off oneliners with ease and even matthau was good matching him their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie also benjamin is very good as willys nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other for me its worth seeing for burns alone this jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had another hit with oh god so this is good just goodnot great matthaus character really makes this hard to love i give it a 7
758,that was the first thing that sprang to mind as i watched the closing credits to europa make there was across the screen never in my entire life have i seen a film of such technical genius the visuals of europa are so impressive that any film i watch in its wake will only pale in comparison forget your michael bay ridley scott slick hollywood cinematography europa has more ethereal beauty than anything those two could conjure up in a million years now id be the first to hail lars von trier a genius just off the back of his films breaking the waves and dancer in the dark but this is stupid the fact that europa has gone unnoticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema whilst overrated rubbish like crouching tiger hidden dragon and life is beautiful clean up at the academy awards but what do the know europa has been hidden away absent form video stores and until recently any british tv channels the visuals in europa are not mtv gloss its not a case of style over substance its more a case of substance dictating style much like his first film the element of crime von trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world and much like element the film begins with the main character or in the case of europa we the audience being hypnotized as we move down the tracks the voice of the narrator max von sydow counts us down into a deep sleep until we awake in europa this allows von trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery there are many scenes in europa when a character in the background who is in black and white will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour von trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot for instance its no surprise that the first shot of leopold kessler jeanmarc barr is in colour since he is the only character whos actions have superiority over the film the performances are good they may not be on par with performances in later von trier films but thats just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you dont really pick up on them the first time round but i would like to point out the fantastic performance of jeanmarc barr in the lead role whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides until he erupts in the films final act again muck like the element of crime the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state left in this terrible place with only the continuing narration of von sydow to seal his fate europa is a tremendous film and i cant help thinking what a shame that von trier has abandoned this way of filming since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time europa much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes his dedication to composition and miseenscene is unrivalled not to mention his use of sound and production design but since his nofrills melodramas turned out to be breaking the waves and dancer in the dark then who can argue but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent 1010
759,across the great divide which we call understanding there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal elders in every instance there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much conversely there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the end time in this movie called  the last wave  an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason when those responsible are arrested they remain silent less they disturb the order of things david burton richard chamberlain plays the defense attorney assigned to defend the accused although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic aboriginal named chris lee david gulpilil burton proceeds to defend the infraction as tribal law and therefore not subject to standard justice the movie is fraught with puzzling dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film its frightening allure and therefore is not for the fainthearted in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers good silent drama 
760,first id like to say that while i know my share about star wars i am not a fanatic i do not know how many chromosomes a wamp rat has or the extended family of tk427 what i know is this star wars all the moviesless so with episode 2 though captured something magical its hard to say what what button lucas has found and boldly pressed but it works star wars is more than a movie its an ideahow may you ask i shall explain star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes good vs evil it does this so obviously so profoundly that literally any person from any environment can understand episode vi does the very well concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father yet also with the addition of the prequels reveals even more to the hinted back story suddenly its darth vader at the front and viewers realize that its the story about anakin not just luke but even before 13 there was amazing depth to it all it felt real as if capsule fell from the sky into lucass lap detailing a historical account of a galaxy far far awaystar wars is definitely something far above the norm and i must admit whenever i see them particularly this one i feel very small i feel as though ive been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined i get a tingling feeling when i see them a feeling that something somehow has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope
761,my comments for vivah  its a charming idealistic love story starring shahid kapoor and amrita rao the film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegrooms families sleeping on the floor playing games together their friendly banter and mutual respect vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals yes the central romance is naively visualized but the sneakedin romantic moments between the tobemarried couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism the film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom on the wedding night tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries come let me do your dressingv i v a h  showcases a lot of good things  beauty of arranged marriage beauty of indian culture beauty of indian woman last but not least a nice idealism of the abouttobecouple waiting to get married  playing by the rules  simple yet beautiful such a simple story  no plot  no villain  as is the case with most of sooraj barjatya films sooraj sir is back to what he does best he has made the movie with full conviction its a very sweet film  which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout arranged marriage  the union of 2 families i think amrita rao  looks very good  she has acted very well she has most of the good scenes  although i thought the last half hour was completely to shahid kapur  who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance i also liked the acting of all others for ex the choti ie amrita prakash alok nath anupam kher shahids bro  sisinlaw it almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after maine pyar kiya hahk  hum saath saath hain the chemistry between shahid  amrita is awesomestuff like sanctity in a marriagerelationship avoiding courtship mutual respect care  space waiting for getting married officially prayingsacrficing for ur beloved  all these and more get showcased in vivah theres still some good audience who r going  enjoying this film some of the folksaudience are already excited after seeing that they r thinking bout arrangedmarriage  thats success if you ask me it seems amrita rao  our actressfromvivah result for a nice performance has been bestowed the prestigious dadsaheb phalke award for 2006  hats off to her for this achievement chalo even though vivah  shahid or amrita didnt get any of the filmfare  other awards  least this is news to cheer about  congrats to amrita rao for showing us a visual of indian bridetobe in the purest form and of course to sooraj barjatya for portraying her the best way  shudnt forget shahid kapur and all others who make vivah as sweet and legendary as it is today  imagine to share the same pedestal as the legendary dilip kumar  its no mean achievement  congrats to amrita rao  for taking her career to another level with this award  i personally feel  she should keep doing movies only with shahid kapur  they make a cute couple and their onscreen chemistry reminds me of srkkajol or aamir khan  juhi chawla  some points that i observedfew of the elements  1 if u notice carefully amrita rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses she gives every bit of the indian woman essence  in this film  perfect fit 2 shahid kapur is like most of us  not exactly ready for marriage or earlymarriage  but prem listens carefully to the stepwise talk given by his dad  having full faith in anupam kher eventually honesty  trust are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with amrita most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person but according to what i saw in this film i have a feeling  that two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also its possible  3 in the entire movie  there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where shahid  amrita are together  or shown to be together its unlike most other romanticweddingbased movies where hero  heroine are always singingdancing or nowadays  doing cheap stuff but the beauty of each of these 5 sequences  characterized by restraint innocence  respect for the other  4 i really liked the relationship shown between chacha alok nath  amrita rao these kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughtersgirlkids in some parts of india 5 romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely  no cheap scenessongs are beautifully pictured  words like jalpraarthana etc are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film  personally i really am fond of many dialogs in this film 6 last but not the least  the entire hospital scene where shahid puts sindhoor to amrita when shes struggling for life  is terrific those dialogs between the couple are so touching and u feel the loveicantdowithoutu  its a hatsoff feeling   in many ways vivah reminded me of maine pyar kiya ddlj qayamat se qayamat tak hum dil de chuke sanam  for the freshnessonscreenchemistry of the lead pair    if u ask me  along with films like rang de basanti lage raho munnabhai dor corporate and kabul express v i v a h ranks among the best films made in 2006 in fact  i think vivah does deserve better viewingbusiness than dhoom2 or fanaa or golmaal or all those timepassfuzzystylecrap movies 
762,the music of albeniz pervades this film once and a while it is played with original instrumentation eg piano but never full orchestra but often it is reworked with various contemporary ensembles egguitar and treatments eg jazz piano only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dances often flamenco but not always i would guess that there are 1214 scenes which are not united by a plot not all scenes will reach the heights for an individual viewer in my case about half reached the pinnacle though all the rest were in their own way very fine those that worked for me moved me to gooseflesh aesthetic delight indeed the final scene left me weepy with joy and in some very magical way it brings you deep into spanish culture if you dont like subtitles dont worry the film is virtually wordless though each scene carries a title of an albeniz piece seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of the films of saura are available on dvd in the usa i am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of carmen a spectacular work of art that is available in europe but not here european dvds wont play on american dvd players this is a scandal
763,as a sequelthis is not a bad moviei actually liked it better than the 1st onei found it more entertainingit seemed like it was shot documentary styleat first this bothered meas i thought it just looked too low budgetbut it grew on meand it made the movie seem more authenticthis movie has more dry one liners than the originalwhich is a good thingin my opinioni do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the charactersit almost becomes a parody of itselfwhich may be the pointthis movie at least has some suspensewhich the 1st one did not havein my viewit has some of the same great music from the originalwhich is greatthe acting again was pretty decent for the most partthough like i saidsome of it seemed over the topi also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just dont seem to flowlike the rest of the movieoverallthoughi thought this was a pretty sequelmy rating for return to cabin by the lake is 710

765,i rated this a ten just because i find it so impressive what a single eighteen year old can do with a video camera its no epic but its plenty engaging and i was never bored if tens of millions of dollars can go into the countless bad films that are poured out en masse then give this director the same amount of money and see what happens i know ill be lining up at the local cinema for her first major release damn good job and well worth the money what a script it might be low budget but it beats the hell out of half the major pictures ive seen lately nanavati knows how to tell a story both in writing and on screen serious kudos to her cant wait to see more
766,basically the exact same movie as house of wax  vincent prices first genuine horror hit released the previous year  but seriously who cares because the mad magician offers just as many sheer thrills delightful period setpieces joyous 3d effects sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor never change a winning team is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down prices character don gallico another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him don gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as gallico the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history entitled the girl and the buzz saw gallicos promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ross ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose stating that all of gallicos inventions are the rightful property of the company the sleazy and relentless ormond who by the way also ransacked gallicos once beloved wife takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallicos rival the great rinaldi inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond but  also being a master of creating disguises  recreates his victims image and even starts leading a double life the mad magician is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50s horror movie in grand guignol style with a whole lot of improbably plot twists the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist and a handful of fantastically grotesque grossout moments although they obviously remain suggestive for most part the 3d delights near the beginning of the film like a yoyo player and a goofy trick with water fountains merely just serve as timefiller and contemporary 50s hype but its still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them the mad magician is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in like no other actor could ever accomplish price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way you pity don gallico yet at the same time you fear him enormously you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death vincent price simply was a genius actor and in my humble opinion the embodiment of the horror genre
767,spoilers spoilersthis movie the divers is really interesting all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish but i decided to check it out for one reason the fact that the story evolves around a sunken wwii german submarine ive got a fetish for german subs especially wrecks that can be dived upon so i was a bit sceptical about the danish part but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part knowing that nordic films arent always that good and not sure of the budget size i was to say the least very scepticalupon viewing i was  surprisedi had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate seeing how some are very young the two main actors in particular this was not an issue they both perform very well as do the other actors who mostly consist of people in their 50s and beyond this makes for some interesting interaction between young and old not often seen on the screen not unique in anyway but somewhat rare and its all goodas for the danish language it is nearly impossible to understand but this was no problem it had subtitlesanother issue was the submarine itself i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine having decided their budget was slim i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at its worst again i was surprised the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic having a fetish for german subs i knew what the sub should look like especially inside and was not let down the team has done some serious research its all goodi suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a warning the submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war its a special purpose sub but to give you a hint of what to expect its a crossing between a type vii type ix and a japanese transport sub similar to i52 its god a good design and makes a nice wreckthe setting is on a danish island or peninsula i cant remember its summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year their grandfather is a mariner of sorts the cinematography is quite nice a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks some newfound teenage love nice diving weather and a general feeling of perfect once again its all goodplotwise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind a gathering of men hire one of the boats an old minesweeper and its crew one of the visitors a man in his 50s has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back the islands senior citizens all remember when a german uboat was sunk towards the end of world war ii and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken uboat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in 1945 no submarine was ever foundwhat to expectkey elements are nazi experiments nazi history treasure hunting secrecy competition teen love conspiracy and a surprise warning  spoiler i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard not being a big fan of supernatural events it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no problem its not like from dusk til dawn where everybody turns into vampires towards the end this is a bit more subtleoverall  really good movie i gave it an 8 some due to the fact that it isnt a hollywood movie with unlimited resources i later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned danish veterans but even if this had been a hollywood production i would give it a 7 or 8 definately worth your while yes a childs story in a way but then again a mature tale it has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure which i found very appealing and again the cinematography is really nicemedusa 2001
768,von trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world so as viewers we think we watch a true story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated often to the point that the movie works disturbing dancer in the dark or painful the idiots idioterne of course the dogmefilms acted only as a vehicle for this theory besides creating some welcome spotlight on von trierthe story is typical for von trier our hero is idealistic seems to balance his relations with everybody else but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves the idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to selfdestruction these elements were also very omnipresent in breaking the waves and dancer in the dark the movie is also full of cynical even humorous undertones about the role of the germans and americans in postwar germanyas a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed shifting and fading washedout colors screen overlays action on different overlays with the shooting of the soontobe mayor as the most interesting in this movie we can see how good von triers handles film as a technical medium in his later works he seems to step down from this as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available
769,im stunt i must admit i never saw a movie with such good story and none stop high special effect martial art fighting scene if you like the fantastic genre like me you will certainly be more than satisfied all character have very cool power and the special effect are near perfection in one word flawless i will listen to this movie a lot in the next years
770,a super unusual film from audiard read my lips is a pulpy lonely hearts thriller its perfect for the handsomely grizzled charisma of vincent cassel and features a marvellously contained performance from emanuelle devos devos is a recurring feature of audiard in the same way that karin viard pops up for jeanpierre jeunet unconventionally beautiful shes referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film versatile and capable of a subordinate profilethis is almost the definition of her role as carla a putupon office dogsbody taunted by colleagues exploiting her deafness yet she finds an ami dexploitation if you like in cassels excon paul each exploits the others unconventional talents theft and lip reading to struggle through their respective situations and form an unconventionally romantic rapprochement devosaudiard manage carlas deafness and its attendant warped inner world with discreet stylish flairin this film 2001 audiard is already clearly in control of his handling on tension action and investing his frame with a truly visceral experience which will become the great hit  a prophet  of nine years later 710
771,the stories in this video are very entertaining and it definately is worth a look the first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks with a great but unexplained twist at the endthe seond is the best of the lot and it alone makes this worth watching  a man is attacked by a dog which he fears to be rabid  he finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital but he finds out the employees there are not exactly what they appear to be great twist at the end and this episode alone scores 1010 if the others were up to par with this one this would get 1010the third is the weakest of the bunch  a girl meets with some guys and has wild sex there appears to be no point to the story until the end with a good little twist but it is spoiled by the awful first partnever the less this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all well worth a rental
772,i must admit that i had my doubts about this movie before i was going to watch it the main reason for that is because it was compared to a hitchcock movie ive seen several movies that were said to be inspired by hitchcock or that could have been made by the master of suspense himself but so far i havent seen any of these movie that would be able to stand the test of time in my opinion hitchcock has become a household name which is too easily used to promote some cheap thrillers but on the other hand i must admit that i was intrigued by it because this is a european movie normally its the big hollywood studios who like to abuse hitchcocks name if that can raise their income but this movie was made in one of the most chauvinistic european countries ever and im sure that most french would rather drop dead than to admit that their movies have been inspired by an englishman thats why i decided to give this movie a try and i must say that im glad that i didsur mes lèvres or read my lips as it is called in english tells the story of a young secretary named carla she is a hardworking and loyal employee but has never been very appreciated by her colleagues that has much to do with the fact that she suffers from a hearing deficiency which has denied her to climb up on the hierarchical ladder of the company but when she is allowed to hire a trainee that can work for her all this is about to change paul angeli is a 25 year old and completely unskilled exconvict the man is a thief but carla gives him a chance and covers for him when needed she hopes to teach him what a regular life should look like but at the same time he drags her with him in his old lifesince i still believe that the name hitchcock is used too often to describe a very good thriller  which this movie definitely is  i will not make any comparisons between hitchcock and jacques audiards directing fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie i hadnt heard of him before but it is true that he knows how to build up suspense and how to keep you interested from the beginning until the end that also has a lot to do with the very fine and original story of course i doubt if there is someone in hollywood who has ever come up with the idea of using a handicapped woman in a powerful role instead of making her the helpless subject of an abusive husband you know the typical tvmovie storyalso worth noticing is the acting in this movie vincent cassel is quite famous but emmanuelle devos was a complete mystery to me there is absolutely nothing glamorous about their roles but they both did an excellent job with their characters making them feel very believable and realistic paul could have been the average tough guy right out of jail and carla the typically helpless woman but thanks to their performances you really believe that these are two strong people who both have had some bad luck in life but who will make the best out of it togetherall in all this is a powerful movie with a very fine script and some excellent acting despite the fact that i had my doubts about it ive soon become one of its greatest admirers i give this movie an 810 dont hesitate to give it a try
773,this is the fifth von trier film i have seen i believe that he is the only director to whom i have given such a high score on all his movies four of them the element of crime europa breaking the waves and dancer in the dark i have given a 10 and one the idiots i have given a 9 and i have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since i first saw it although id like to see it once more before i do he has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors i tend to agree with him i cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films in 50 years when von trier retires he will be looked upon as the preeminent film artist from europe perhaps from the planet and there will be classes taught in his name he simply is the bergman or fellini of our time it is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice thisabout europa itself ill admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong i think thats the point this film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare or the subconscious at some level this is absolutely clear from the framing of the film max von sydows narration we are hypnotized or von trier is hypnotized and this is ourhis subconscious mind im inclined to lean more towards his mind since the degradation of europe concerns me an american very little this framing is also clear if you have seen the element of crime an even more brilliant film than this although i am disputing that in my mind what europa needs more than anything is a proper release on dvd hopefully criterion again with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture then i am fairly sure this film would seem as great as any of von triers other films in the element of crime the film begins with a hypnotist whom we actually see on screen this time is hypnotizing fisher a european detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish the first words of that film are fantasy is okay but my job is to keep you on track and whenever fisher the narrator gets off track the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story he even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line something along the lines of do you understand the difference between good and evil the hypnotist laughs and says now fisher she didnt really say that did sheso the key to interpreting europa almost a sequel of sorts to the element of crime is that we are deep in ourvon triers subconscious and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone what does the train itself symbolize consider it internally and only then discuss it externally europa is a great film a masterpiece i was never bored by it even though i watched it at 3 am the perfect time to watch actually since it works in dream logic
774,i read many commits when it was in the theaters and they were all badi think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies if you are not a person that enjoyed the waltons or little houseu will not understand nor enjoy these moviesnow about loves abiding joyi knew he was bad news from the start of the moviei wish it would have shown more of the end instead of letting you just think it this movie has a lot to do with jeffit is 6 years later so you know he will be interested in girlsi want to say that i have enjoyed all 4 movies so farwas not crazy about the bookscant wait until the next movie the way clark talks will get you every time i would love to see january jones do an appearancemaybe a family reunion or something
775,well what can i say having just watched this fantastic film when my nerves are still jangling jacques audiard the director must be making quite a name for himself in france and rightly so vince cassel is no tom cruise and emmanuelle devos is no penelope cruz either but these two are fantastic actors and this is a taut and compelling thriller which starts off slowly with some clever character building and then starts to put tension on tension to a wonderful climax others have written about the plot so i will not say more than everyone in this film plays their role to perfection the director the actors right down to the cameraman and everything seems so real no stupid gun play the fighting when it happens is so credible the expressions the emotions it is almost as you are there as a spectator do yourself a favour get the dvd a bottle of wine turn the lights low take the phone off the hook and immerse yourself in this hitchcockian thriller 
776,story about four teenage girls growing up in california jeanie jodie foster is the most levelheaded of the bunchbut wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother sally kellerman annie cherie currie is addicted to drugs alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father madge marilyn kagan has overprotective parents deirde kandice stroh thinks shes more mature than the rest of themthis is nothing new from what weve seen plenty of times beforebut this one has one big differenceits accurate i graduated from high school in 1980 when i first saw the film and i was surprised at how realistic it was they got the dialogue clothes and attitudes down completely right even the main song of the movie on the radio by donna summer was a big hit before this came out this film hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because i could understand and relate to the characters i knew girls in high school who were just like this the film is of course dated but it captures a time we will never see againthe acting is good on all counts with foster giving the best performance the relationship between her and kellerman who was excellent was realistic and welldone even scott baio who has a small role as a friend of the girls more or less realistically played a teen boya very good movieessential viewing if you came of age in 1980 the film has a deserved r rating plenty of drug use and swearing but should be seen by all teens i give it a 8
777,this cecil b demille epic of the old west contains what may be jean arthurs finest performance as a hysterical eccentric incurably amoral but devotedly doting calamity jane she really pulled it off gary cooper is at his most taciturn but manages some occasional pithy sayings the plains are big but trails cross  sometimes the story is a pastiche to end all pastiches all the cowboy heroes of western lore seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james even abraham lincoln opens the story in person or at least demille would have us believe so there is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety this is a stomp em in the face tale for the masses a remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what eisenhower was eventually to name the military industrial complex it isnt just a story about gunrunners but about arming anyone for money and doing so from the heart of washington but lets not get into politics lets leave that to demille who can be guaranteed to be superficial the chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by george antheil who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography bad boy of music antheil seems to have originated the big sound adopted by all subsequent westerns whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies that is why it does not sound at all unusual because we have heard it a thousand times but he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into american mythic lore and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then corny as it may be but doubtless appropriate it is amusing to see anthony quinn in an early appearance as a cheyenne indian gabby hayes is in there somewhere but you miss him in the crowd gary cooper overtops them all looming large  but when did he ever loom small
778,dont say i didnt warn you but your gonna laugh probably enough to hurt your stomach sure its got some blood splattering all in good fun though so its got no budget who needs a budget when you got a script like this take the time and check this out well worth a two hour viewing if everyone could laugh as much as i did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to live
779,tales from the crypt and all through the house starts on christmas eve as elizabeth mary ellen trainor kills her husband joseph marshall bell she drags his body outside ready to throw it down a well but while doing so misses an important news bulletin on the radio that says a homicidal maniac larry drake dressed as santa clause has escaped from a local mental asylum  has already killed several women with elizabeth next on his list but she has other ideas  tries to turn the seemingly dangerous situation to her advantagethis tales from the crypt story was episode 2 from season 1 directed by the one of the shows regular executive producers robert zemeckis and all through the house is a decent enough watch the script by fred dekker was actually based on a story appearing in the comic the vault of horror  was originally adapted to film as one episode from the britsih horror anthology film tales from the crypt 1972 which starred joan collins as the murderous wife character here played by ellen trainor this particular version is good enough but doesnt do anything different or special  is a bit too linear  predictable to be considered a classic at only 25 minutes in length it certainly moves along at a good pace the story is just about macabre enough  it generally provides decent entertainment  i quite liked the downbeat ending this time there are christmas themed opening  closing crypt keeper john kassir segments complete with the usual punsdirector zemeckis does a good job  theres a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of christmas influence as well theres not much gore here someone has a poker stuck in their head someones face is cut with an icicle someones arm is cut with an axe  theres some blood splatter but generally speaking its not that graphic the acting by a small cast is pretty goodand all through the house isnt the best tale from the crypt but its a decent one all the same worth a watch but after the comic book story  original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this
780,this final entry in george lucass star wars movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot however this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series on the contrary sure its not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slowgoing at times but return of the jedi still offers a lot to warrant the price of admissionthe first third of the movie where luke and his friends rescue han from the palace of jabba the hutt is a classic jabba a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language not only makes a great villain but a memorable one too it must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product actually what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of jabbas court including the intimidating slavering rancor and scary sarlaac pit monster it builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the whilethings get a little bit slower around the second act where luke discovers that he and leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of endor home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart ewoks most of the complaints about return of the jedi that ive read seem to be centered on these furry creatures in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga i dont totally agree with that although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should however their leader wicket played by warrick davis is a delightfully memorable creation and watching how they handle the imperial troops technology with their simple natural weapons provides a nice contrastby the time we get to the third act though the pace picks up again as we intercut between the ewoks battle against the troops lando and the rebel forces launching an attack against the empires allnew halfcompleted death star and lukes final showdown with darth vader and the emperor the latter ties with the jabba palace sequence as the highlight of the movie mark hamill flexes his acting chops once again as luke skywalker in these scenes and watching him as a fully matured jedi knight makes for an unforgettable performance also as iconic as james earl jones voice as darth vader is he is rivaled only by the shriveled cronelike emperor played with deliciously raspy frightening evil by ian mcdiarmid the tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscoredthe star wars movies have always set standards for special effects and the technical work in return of the jedi can easily hold a candle to its predecessors the space battle fights are as exhilarating as always and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout of course given that this movie was made after a new hope and the empire strikes back it probably shouldnt be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence the acting is classic star wars fare hamill harrison ford and carrie fisher all mature and deepen into their roles and anthony daniels provides more hilarious moments as c3po frank ozs yoda only appears in two scenes but he makes the most of it and yes theres also john williams musicall told while return of the jedi falters a little bit in the middle the first and third acts deliver in style making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas everin 1997 george lucas rereleased the classic star wars in digitally restored and revamped special editions which featured addedin effects andor shots as well as some enhancements of the three return of the jedi appears to have caused the most commotion with star wars fans perhaps it can be due to the jarringly outofplace albeit funny if youre not so easily offended jedi rocks musical number in jabbas palace which although technically amazing does disrupt the flow of the film however i did like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy this dvd version features yet more tweakingwe get to see more montage finale scenes notably on naboo where we hear what sounds like jar jar binks screaming wesa free and in what is probably the most controversial change hayden christensen as the specter of anakin skywalker in the closing scenes probably due to the intense and unfair disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in episode ii attack of the clones it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone however if youre watching the star wars saga chronologically and contemplating about it chances are you may react a little differently nonetheless it is an issue that fans have raised so its probably best to be warned beforehandas nice as it would be to have lucas release the original versions of these three classic films he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the definitive editions of his classic trilogy and when viewing the star wars movies altogether as one complete saga as lucas intended it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent the original films will always be engraved in our memories but these new incarnations are just as much fun if one can give them a chance
781,this is one of the first independent movies ive ever seen for such a very low budget it was done well as an insomniac myself i can sympathize with the main character although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing well directed well acted of a subject that i havent seen much in theaters lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting there are few noticeable goofs but they may be intended youll see after you watch the movie the movie is very personal and worth watching twice no movie is flawless but a hollywood version couldnt do the story better all in all 810
782,this cute animated short features two comic icons  betty boop and henryhenry is the bald slightly portly boy from the comics who never speakswell here he does speakhe wants to get a puppy from betty boops pet store and when he is left to mind the store  some hilarious hijinks ensuebetty sings a song about pets henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey but everything works out in the end
783,the best way for me to describe europa which is high on the list of my favourite films is the exclamation that came from a companion after the film ended i didnt know films could be made like that entirely original in its visual style it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be its as far away from the master and coverage style of shooting as one can get perfectly integrating many layers of image sound effects props dialogue voice over performance editing lighting etc all equal none predominant despite hollywoods dialogue myopia cinema is not about dialogue nor is it about beautiful lighting action or music it works best when all the elements are on an equal footing where only the blending of those elements in the order or combination in which they are presented will communicate the idea reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element and the film has no meaning europa is what cinema should strive to be
784,im rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in luzhins game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final despite the use of jonathan speelman as consultant chess expert luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move in between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after luzhins combination culminating in a queen sacrifice his rook on d1 is still pinned by blacks rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1 thus he is unable to play the purported mating move rd1d8 which would be illegal  but hes shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience
785,dramatic license  some hate it though it is necessary in retelling any life story in the case of lucy the main points of lucille balls teenage years early career and 20 year marriage to desi arnaz are all included albeit in a truncated and reworked waythe main emotional points of lucys life are made clear lucilles struggle to find her niche as an actress finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character lucy ricardo a legend her turbulent romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to desi arnaz lucy  desi creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as tvs most memorable sitcom coupleas lucille ball rachel york does a commendable job do not expect to see quite the same miraculous transformation like the one judy davis made when playing judy garland but york makes ball strongwilled yet likable and is very funny in her own right even though her comedictiming is different than lucys she is still believable the film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set and her mistreatment of vivian vance during the early i love lucy years but watching york portray lucy rehearsing privately is a nice inclusiondaniel pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real desi was but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with desis accent especially in the opening scene madeline zima was decent if not overly memorable as the teenaged lucyvivian vance and william frawley were not featured much thankfully since rebecca hobbs and russell newman were not very convincing in the roles not that they arent good actors in their own right they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing most of the actors were from austrailia and new zeland and the repressed accents are detectable at timesalthough the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact there are many deviations some for seemingly inexplicable reasons jess oppenheimer the head writer of lucys radio show my favourite husband which began in 1948 is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with i love lucy in 1951 completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator this movie also depicts marc daniels as being the main i love lucy director for its entire run completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by william asher after the first season also though i figure this was due to budgetary constraints the ricardos are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in new york when in reality they changed apartments in 1953 the kitchen set is slightly larger and offscale from the original as well the connecticut home looks pretty close to the original except the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured theres also desi talking about buying rko in 1953 during lucys redscare incident even though rko did not hit the market until 1957 these changes well could have been for dramatic license and the film does work at conveying the main facts but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to oppenheimer and asher two vital figures in i love lucy history the biggest gaff comes in the i love lucy recreation scenes at least a few of them its always risky recreating something that is captured on film and has been seen by billions of people but even more so when obvious changes are made the scene with the giant bread loaf was truncated and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away the were having a baby number was shortened as well but other than that it was practically dead on by far the best was the grapestomping scene with rachel york really nailing lucys mannerisms the producers made the wise decision not to attempt directly recreating the vitametavegamin and candy factory bits instead showing the actors rehearse them these scenes proved effective because of that approachthe films main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about lucys life since much is skimmed over or omitted at all overall though it gives a decent portrait of lucy  desis marriage and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively
786,not to mention easily pierce brosnons best performance of course greg kinnear is always great really when has he really been bad i think this film is incredibly underrated the use of colors in this movie is something very different in todays film world where every other movie has the payback blue filter i also love the way they used the song by asia proving that even what was once thought of as kinda cheesy can be really cool placed correctlyi was making my first feature when this came out being that my film was a hitman movie i had to check out anything in the genre that was released after seeing it im sure it had some effect on me through the process it was pretty cool when my film got on the imdb that it would recommend this film if you liked mine how any of the others relate i have no idea making an even more interesting coincidencehttpwwwimdbcomtitlett1337580
787,i saw a lot films about charles dickens christmas carol but this one is the best of all there is an atmosphere which is exactly the same as in the book the actors george c scott and others are great unfortunately you cant often watch the film in germany and switzerland
788,of all the reviews ive read most people have been exceedingly hard on alexandre neither marie or veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep alexandre he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual as most of us are however hard it may be for anyone to admit alexandre is getting away with life perfectly being totally taken care of getting and giving what he wants the girls are allowing this veronika loves sex marie is his patron is there anything wrong with any of this is anyone in love really i dont think so though french new wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in alexandres position in an urban area can ask for im looking for a patron anyone interested
789,the matador is hitman movie liteif you can say that about a hitman movie the violence is never really shown but often introduced at first i was scared i was in for another retread of mid90s gangsterhitmanhipsterdark comedy but was happily surprised when i realized this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me grinning the three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together the writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes this is a good film that i probably wont remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy good film
790,lars von triers europa is an extremely good film hows that von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story at least he did have with europa to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen even with all the tricks in my opinion this film is the most complete real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list i also think it is perhaps the scariest the most gothic and complete film around all right there are other good ones too but this one is my favorite the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever
791,i have to say although i despise these kind of shows shock horror im a girl i feel i have to express my opinion i had seen dirty sanchez before i saw jackass and think it way surpasses jackass in terms of programme making story lines and interviews are inter weaved to create a more interesting show i saw a few minutes of jackass movie the other night and couldnt believe how poorly put together it was everything just put in a line joke after joke with no relation between anything it must have been the quickest easiest show to edit ever shockingly amateur while drinking puke isnt really my thing as far as a substantial entertainment show goes dirty sanchez is way out of jackasss league
792,i have read the short story by norman maclean and the movie did justice to norman macleans writing my husband tends to reread it occasionally and i myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind we have videos of many of redford s movies and we have watched a river runs through it many times redford is part of the famdamily as he is always around we never get tired of redfords perception of norman maclean writings and the beauty of montana the script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as mr macleans father according to a river runs through it methodists are baptists who can read a line which by the way is not in the short story but i think that is a funny line my husband and i are wellread baptistsi have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow i disagree as one search for inner peace this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in threefour rhythm of the metronome the photography is outstanding the acting is great i love the scene where norman and paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer then as adult paul played by brad pitt se7ven is the perfect guy who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it the same applies to neal burns who uses worms as bait he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help the scene where paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace finally after hours they all kneel around the table to say grace and they all leave but the oatmeal stayed on the plate that scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors that is funny the sunburn the drive back home where jessie burns emily lloyd decides to go via the train line beautiful dialogue when norman proposes to jessie because he wants her to come to chicago with himredford himself does a superb job as a narrator i could not stop myself from comparing brad to the young redford barefoot in the park the nominated director producer actor is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the us but around the world i am glad to live in nineteen hundred because i have seen the beginning of the black and white television the movies and all the technology and special effects to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as redford because i have had the chance to see his works redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of montana in this masterpiece the river to me means that line that separates life from death memories and realities redford shows the hands of the creator so magnificently and a river runs through it
793,foxes is one movie i remember for its portrayal of teenagers in the late 1970s as i am exactly jodie fosters age i related to this movie it deals with the frustrations temptations relationships  rebellion of youth the soundtrack is great with inspiring rock eg more than a feeling by boston and sad numbers like on the radio by donna summer the music of my late teens yep ill always remember this one even if it wasnt huge
794,i didnt know what to except so i think it was a lot better not having excepted much dont get my wrong its not a bad short film tess nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer so i think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film you can tell that it has been an act of love for her the acting outside of dominic is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good there was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on though i dont feel it greatly detracts for ones ability to understand the film if you love dominic monaghan as much as i do i say go for it the gag reel was fun i wont spoil it but there is a particular scene that makes buying the dvd worth it just so you can watch it over and over if you like the film then check out the pink mirror a film also done by jagged edge i know fans of dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven
795,ten out of ten stars its hard to believe this was a made for television movie just the phrase made of tv makes me shudder the production values for made for tv movies are almost always remarkably lower than production values for professional movie studios that being said this version of the christmas carol should have been released in theaters because it is that good its my personal favorite of all the christmas carol movies because every aspect of this production are of the highest quality yes there are some minor on screen glitches with two of the ghosts that visit scrooge but there isnt a movie in existence that doesnt have at least a couple of mistakesscott turns in a stellar performance as scrooge hes a pleasure to watch in fact i cant think of one performance in this film that shouldnt be applauded the costuming location shooting and winter backdrop are mesmerizing the musical score is endearing and heart warming add to that solid directing flawless cinematography and faithful scripting we have here what will one day be considered a holiday classic it really hasnt been around long enough to be a classic but mark my words one day soon it will be this film has turned into a yearly christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind christmas love selflessness and giving in as selfish greedy world my family and i can lose ourselves in the christmas carol starring george c scott
796,wow i have seen so many bad low budget films lately but this one is great the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series i loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent cliché about the police this film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time a perfect tradeoff
797,in answer to the person who made the comment about how the film drags on and who believed there was no purpose to the role of jesss brother here is my responsethe role of jesss brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story craig sheffernorman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how jesss brother turned out there are various instances where brad pitt and his lives run in parallel for example when jesss brother takes craig sheffer to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds brad pitt there a few days later the dramatic irony was there so craig sheffers character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film
798,when it comes to creating a universe george lucas is the undisputed master and his final star wars film is very very good and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga having recently seen revenge of the sith really puts this movie in perspective the final battle seems even more climactic knowing what anakin skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the emperor it also makes the final battle between luke and vader more bitter considering the love he felt for padmé and the love she felt for her children actually while the new films especially episode ii are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only they make the old films seem even bettermark hamill does an exceptional job in this movie he really brings the changes luke has gone through seem real in all fairness i believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job harrison ford is still good however you can feel that he has done raiders and blade runner in between the two final chapters of star wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit he adds more comedy obviously inspired from raiders to the character which works brilliantly in short han solo is better than ever carrie fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable ian mcdiarmid appears in this film and having seen episode iii i can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever james earl jones still provides the voice for vader and he is still very very goodin terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the star wars universe looks better than in either of the previous two movies but this was always lucas forté so that is really to be expected the final battle over endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise it was also a nice touch that lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax the only thing i feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the ewoks these little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in besides i find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of storm troopers with laser guns and mighty machineryall in all return of the jedi is a very good movie but the fact that richard marquand is a less accomplished director than irvin kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant also george lucas stupid decision to add the ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance810
799,i really truly enjoyed this movie which is why it surprised me that it got such a low rating from so many users at this site i am not saying that it is a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold snowy saturday night it is funny poignant and a great tales of the ups and downs of female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each others fess up ladies we have all been there bill paterson shines as the reverand gerald marsden and andie mcdowell proves that she can be a fine actress when the role is right and she puts her mind to it and truly there is the best wedding escape that i have ever seen or dreamed up in this film  more guts than anyone i have ever known you will laugh and you will cry  ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film is being marketing  it is a hidden gem that should have done tonnes of box office now i have to look around to purchase a copy
800,there are some films that every horror fan owes himself or herself to see and emilio miraglias la dama rossa uccide sette volte aka the red queen kills seven times 1972 is definitely one of them with gialli and gothic tales being my two favorite subgenres in horror i was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while and even though my expectations were high this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes miraglias earlier giallo the night evelyn came out of the grave 1971 was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed giallo with gothic horror but it couldnt possibly compare to this instant personal favorite the red queen kills seven times is hands down one of the most unique and overwhelming italian horror films ever made and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it an incredibly mesmerizing giallo with strong gothic elements the red queen delivers everything one could hope for in either subgenre an inventive and incredibly compelling plot spinechilling suspense a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere eerily lush colors stylish murders a brilliant score and not least a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful barbara bouchet  this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terrorthe film starts out incredibly in a beautiful gothic castle in germany as little girls kitty wildenbrück and her sister evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting legend has it that a fiendish red lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people fourteen years later kitty barbara bouchet has become a successful fashion photographer suddenly people begin to get murdered director miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style atmosphere and colorful creepiness with the night evelyn came out of the grave and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem the red queen kills seven times is a feast for the eyes indeed and one of the most overwhelming italian horror films both visually and plotwise the haunting painting in the grandfathers castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps the red lady or red queen as she is called in the english title is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a giallo the spinechilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own a sexy female cast is always appreciated especially in a giallo and this one is a prime example for that the ravishing barbara bouchet one of my favorite actresses must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen and she is a great actress too bouchets presence has graded up many italian flicks among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest cultmasterpieces of italian 70s cinema within one year 1972 fernando di leos milano calibro 9 lucio fulcis giallohighlight dont torture a duckling and this unforgettable gem apart from the wonderful miss bouchet the films gorgeous female cast includes sexy young sybil danning marina malfatti the night evelyn came out of the grave and other beauties who are not afraid to bare it for the camera as the whole film the murders are stylish and extremely elegant yet frightening and macabre and some of them are quite gory bruno nicolais mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets and makes the films intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting the plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings the tensionlevel increses with each passing minute the red queen begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second overall this is one of the films that i cannot find enough words of praise for the red queen kills seven times is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest gialli ever made and a toppriority for every fan of horror andor italian cinema to see 1010
801,this is a good family show with a great cast of actors its a nice break from the reality show blitz of late there is nothing else quite like it on television right now either unless you count joan of arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too anyway clubhouse is worth a look because jeremy sumpter gives the main character pete young a kind of likability and naiveté that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly dean cain christopher lloyd mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the rest of the main cast members and each is terrific in their role i really like kirsten storms as petes sister betsy she is quite a pill but she still cares about her mom and brother even though she hates to show it it may take a few episodes to really find its legs but clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while so check it out peopleyoull be glad you did
802,i know many people have a special fondness for the alistair sim version of dickens story but for me this 1984 version is the one to beat my wife and i own a copy of this film on vhs and we watch it together every christmas eve i often remark that we could watch it on halloween too because its a very creepy ghost storyscotttypecast as scroogeis shudderingly mean and nasty making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving i think its up there with his performance in patton the spirits are all effective each one creepier than the last watching the dark floating skeletal form of the spirit of christmas yet to come sends shivers down my spine every year and what a supporting cast david warner in particular is in top form as bob cratchit as is susannah york as his wife i seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most othersbut i may be mistaken as its been several years since i read it regardless this is a terrific christmas classic
803,marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy show people released by mgm in 1928 davies plays a hick from savannah georgia who arrives in hollywood with her father dell henderson the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot  as is davies outrageous southern costume davies lands a job in slapstick comedy not what she wants but it brings her success she meets fellow slapstick star william haines who is immediately smitten with her well davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio high art studios and lands a job in stuffy period pieces a handsome but fake actor andre telefair shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life but of course learns that is not who she really is marion davies is wonderful throughout as she  outrageously  runs the gamut of emotions required of a serious actress william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self and there are cameos by charles chaplin john gilbert and other famous stars of the day including the director of the film king vidor this is a silent film with a few sound effects as sound pictures were just coming into their own a treasure of a film
804,i couldnt have been more thrilled just eight years old back in 1983 i was going to see a star wars movie at the theater the best day of my life was about to happen to that time my only star wars experience had been a few hbo showings of star wars i hadnt even seen the empire strikes back yetand boy did that day deliver for my less critical eyes jabba big rebel spaceships the emporer a greenbladed lightsaber wow since that magical day i must have watched this movie hundreds of times i cant even form an accurate estimate at this point with those multiple viewings i have of course observed that this movie  the real episode iii  does have its flawsof course in the context of a star wars movie those flaws are more like quirksmillions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980 in may of 1983 i had mine and this was my star wars movie
805,home room deals with a columbinelike highschool shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors their trauma guilt and denialspoilers the shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage swat commando after shooting the high school killer the film has three protagonists the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident played by a very young erika christensen and busy philippsthe two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensueserika christensen though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting busy philipps three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence this girl was the partits a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls gus van sants elephant 2003 though good seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure  so much more a loss for an equally traumatized americaten out of ten
806,piece of subtle art maybe a masterpiece doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence tale in kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world the life is in this film only exercise of adaptation lesson about limits and original sin about the frailty of innocence and error of his waysleopold kessle is another joseph k images of trial and same ambiguous woman and europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truthessencegolden agemethaphor or parable the movie is history of disappointeds evolution war peace business or lie are only details of gelatintime hypocrisy is a mask love a convention the sacrifice only method to hope understanding a painful reality
807,sunny a cocktail waitress in the dc area is a bit dim to put in mildly she drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple however she saves the life of a prominent arab by taking a bullet in the behind that was meant for the official she charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks sniffing an opportunity presidential aides get her installed in the protocol department for the us government even then she messes things up at times but she tries hard and learns a lot she even grabs the romantic attention of a state department official but is there another sinister plot in the making involving an arab man who wishes to take another wife a blonde one lol lol lol this movie features goldie as pretty as a picture and as dumb as a fox as they say sunny learns her way around the jungle of the us government very very well she even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings perhaps the arab community would be less than thrilled with this work but for those who like to laugh rent this today
808,if you like jamie foxxalvin sandersdate from hell01 you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with shrimp jumbo size and at the same time lots of gold bars alvin sanders has plenty of fbi eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw and david morseedgar clenteen hack 02 tv series decides to zero in on poor alvin and use him as a so called fish hook to attract the criminals there is lots of laughs drama cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the junk yard jamie foxx and david morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture
809,taking over roles that jack albertson and sam levene played on broadway walter matthau and george burns play a couple of old time vaudeville comics a team in the tradition of joe smith and charles dale who seem to have a differing outlook on lifewalter matthau cant stop working the man has never learned to relax take some time and smell the roses hes a crotchety old cuss whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent richard benjamin is finding less and less work for him what hurt him badly was that some 15 years earlier his partner george burns decided to retire and spend some time with his family a workaholic like matthau cant comprehend it and take burnss decision personallybenjamin hits on a brain storm reunite the guys and do it on a national television special what happens here is pretty hilariousthe sunshine boys is also a sad bittersweet story as well about old age matthau is on screen for most of the film but its burns who got the kudos in the form of an oscar at the ripe old age of 79burns brought a bit of the personal into this film as well as we all know he was the straight man of the wonderful comedy team of burnsallen who the monty python troop borrowed a lot from in 1958 due to health reasons gracie allen retired and george kept going right up to the age of 100 or at least pretty close to as an active performerthe sunshine boys is based on the team of smithdale however and if you like the sunshine boys i strongly recommend you see two tickets to broadway for a look at a pair of guys who were entertaining the american public at the turn of the last century the doctor sketch that matthau and burns do is directly from their materialand i do think you will like the sunshine boys
810,this film starts out with a family who were all going in different directions and their teenage daughter martha macissac olivia dunne was very much in love with joe macleodzack the mother is played by mitzi kapturejill dunne who suddenly walks in on her daughter and zack making out and then all kinds of problems seem to surface jill dunne has a husband who is always traveling or staying away from the home quite often there are also big problems that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip which their daughter olivia dislikes and just cannot adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to be kept out all the bugs in many ways olivia does an outstanding performance as the teenage and nick mancusorichard grant gives a great supporting role as a hotel owner this film will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a film filled with plenty of horror and terror enjoy
811,i saw this movie years ago on late night television back then it went by the title of stairway to heaven even as a young boy i remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial those who have seen it know what im talking about such imagination a perfect blend of romance drama humour and fantasy this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made citizen kane casablanca gone with the wind this movie is rated extremely high by imdb voters and rightly so  over 51 voters rated it 10 out of 10 over 84 rated it 8 or higher out of 10 i was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until i realized so few have seenrated this movie compared to those on the list what a pity i hope this movie gets released on dvd for region 1 north america so that 1 i can purchase it and 2 others discover this hidden treasure
812,a few years ago i added a comment to the imdb on the real mccoys tv series i said then and repeat now it was a charming funny and entertaining show wellacted with wonderful characterizationsi recently saw on dvd four old episodes plus the reunion of 2000 with richard crenna kathy nolan and tony martinez as another writer here mentioned it is curious that lydia reed hassie and michael winkelman little luke werent refered to but perhaps they can be tracked down via sag or aftrathe reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show one piece of inside information we did not get was whether or not kathy nolan regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute which left luke a widow in its last year which wasnt very good nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called broadside about women nurses in the pacific in ww ii get it broadside no not funnyunlike the sleazy salacious and violent trash on tv now that is so undermining our values the real mccoys entertained with decent values and fine human beings and i thank all involved including the creator irving pinkus for having brought it to my family we never missed it
813,this is an almost actionless film following jack an insomniac as he goes through hallucinations is visited by dead friends throws himself off a building and for a lot of the time cant tell reality from hallucinationdominic monaghan as jack is truly believable confused and scared but lethargic and at times blankly accepting of what he sees we follow him trying to sort out what hes seeing and find a way to sleepintroduce a talking dog another hallucination and children that suddenly appear in jacks bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there more hallucination and you have an interesting mind boggling 43 minutes and the shower scene is enough to get any dom fan coming back for more
814,this is the best series of its type ive seen all year i cant help thinking its just my luck  a series i love gets 6 episodes and more next year and the constant stream of cookiecutter cop shows get never ending episodesi think the reasons new tricks succeeds are many the scripts are good and the mix of characters superb the acting is top flight and the blend of comedy and drama works a treat the stories arent all that memorable but thats not the reason i watch shows like this one the theme song is a favourite and we were disappointed to find it isnt available in any published edition great stuff bbc a triumph of sense over sexappeal aside from the young constable nobodys there as eyelolly and even if he is he can still act
815,obsession comes in many flavors and exists for a variety of reasons for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder but for others it may be an avenue of survival lack of nurturing combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone and in extreme cases the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing and as we discover in the luzhin defence directed by marleen gorris a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem and in fact may actually exacerbate the situation obsession it seems has no prejudice or preference moreover it gives no quarter	at an italian resort in the 1920s alexander luzhin john turturro is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament the winner of which will be the world champion luzhin is a master of the game but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him rather it is his obsession that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family so luzhin is a genius with an achilles heel a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament that man is valentinov stuart wilson luzhins former mentor who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to luzhin	valentinov is an unwelcomed disconcerting presence to luzhin and once again life threatens to overwhelm him not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament turati fabio sartor against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life his feelings for a young woman hes just met at the resort natalia emily watson and genius though he may be dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace as well the curse of his entire life	to tell luzhins story gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess and as his background is established it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life for the scenes of his childhood gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into and underlies the present more pastoral setting of the resort the transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled and with the pace gorris sets it makes for a riveting yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well she also underplays the menace produced by the presence of valentinov concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film making luzhins tragedy all the more believable and unsettling	the single element that makes this film so memorable however is the affecting performance of john turturro for this film to work luzhin must be absolutely believable one false or feigned moment would be disastrous as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately it doesnt happen however and the film does work because the luzhin turturro creates is impeccably honest and truetolife he captures luzhins genius as well as his inadequacies and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real its a performance equal to if not surpassing geoffrey rushs portrayal of david helfgott in shine and when you compare his work here with other characters hes created from sid lidz in unstrung heroes to pete in o brother where art thou to al fountain in box of moonlight you realize what an incredible range turturro has as an actor and what a remarkable artist he truly is	as natalia emily watson is excellent as well turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to luzhin watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective most importantly because of the detail she brings to her performance it makes her accelerated relationship with luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story you have but to look into watsons eyes to know that the feelings shes conveying are real its a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor	the supporting cast includes geraldine james vera christopher thompson stassard peter blythe ilya orla brady anna mark tandy luzhins father kelly hunter luzhins mother alexander hunting young luzhin and luigi petrucci santucci well crafted and delivered the luzhin defence is an emotionally involving film presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon mans inhumanity to man we dont need a movie of course to tell us that there is cruelty in the world but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change and to make a difference in the lives of those around us i rate this one 910   
816,beware spoilers this movie was okay goldie hawn and chris sarandon were the best two in it okay so the goofie foreign guy who spoiler here trades with the biker for his clothes was funny this guys boss was good too but the movie really belonged to sarandon and hawn these two should have had a lot more time on screen together theyre chemistry was great the bathroom scenewow romantic sweet yummyhawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians to talk about sarandon would be to give a lot away spoilers this is a rather untypical romanticpolitical comedy and it satisfies both somewhatthe political side a whole lot more than the romantic it touches on political issues and just barely skims on romantic areas
817,one would have to be very jaded indeed not to be swept up into this gem of a film and ive seen hundreds of hindi and bollywood movies too the actors the beautiful settings locations and surroundings the deep emotions portrayed the sweet songs especially the singing voice of udit narayan my favorite  everything was just lovely the human imperfect element was also woven in to create some drama and drive the plot as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution alok nath is such a terrific actor so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays he almost steals the show from the young stars i highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true romances  ones that go beyond superficial beauty to real love  as one of the best films out there hindi or otherwise
818,having no knowledge of this film prior to seeing it on rialto channel i found it to be a pleasant poignant and enriching film the casting was excellent i loved all the characters they were a little exaggerated in places but this is a film the way it looked and the enjoyably giddy ride the main character took until it turned badly as real life can and does yes i thought andy macdowell was great i was particularly interested to watch this film once it began because people so often joke about her acting abilities i find this quite wierd because shes always a solid actress in my opinioni loved the bit at the end where andys character said sometimes i feel he was never here etc it was so completely how it really is in a situation like that which i can personally identify with then there was that gorgeous classical piece nocturne i think by chopin which was a beautiful way to end bar the light comedy at the end which was probably unnecessaryi say well done to the film makers  i have seen 1000s of worse films
819,i dont know if im just weird but i thoroughly enjoyed this film return to cabin by the lake is of course the sequel to another one of my favorite films cabin by the lake in fact i think that i enjoyed this movie even more than the first one i also thought that the cast in this movie was great judd nelson is always the best i also enjoyed the plot as a whole i liked the fact that this second movie focused on the filming of stanleys screenplay cabin by the lake it wasnt a completely redundant film of stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them  if youre looking for some deep meaning then this film is probably not the one for you however if youre looking for a fun way to spend two hours then go ahead and watch it ive probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film 
820,xica da silva is one of the best brazilians opera soap ever the a black slaves story that becomes queen of a small villa when conquering the most powerful mans of the area love in the colonial period of the brazil dominated by portugal that explored its diamonds the largest xica enemy violante bride that it was changed by xica is a woman of big it influences the portugal king close to and does to take revenge of the slave of everything very religious person she is a picture of the hypocritical society and religious of the time she dedicates its life the morality of the villa that was committed by xica that is a woman full of lusts that it faces the society of the time to preach and it helps the slaves of the area the story also bill with forbidden loves sorceries and vampires and religious fervor xica da silva does with that you dont want to lose a i only surrender from beginning to end
821,this is one of the best movies it is one of my favorites a movie with good acting the story is very sensitive and touching good camera work alsothe names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the american star list however they give equal or better performances than the top of the listit is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love romance friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kickbox their way to save the worldif you dont like this movie then you have no heart or feelings then go watch a sports movie there is no killing or horror here see the movie it is a must th
822,i absolutely loved this movie i am not even sure what particularly about it but i think it was wonderful and should be available for dvd the women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the villa in italy the actors in my opinion did an excellent job the characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work there is humor drama and relationship issues all in good time this requires 10 lines but i just cant think of any more to say so i will just rattle on until i get 10 lines so sorry about this what else can i possibly say it has been a long time since i last saw it i am looking forward to view again but it isnt available
823,the color purple is truly amazing there is none like it and i dont think there ever will be its a roller coster of emotion and pain that the viewer takes on the actors are flawless and the directing is superb i absolutely loved it a movie has never made me so happy it is beautiful thats the best way to explain it
824,few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later yet remain as engrossing as this one technological advances have not dated this classic love story special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie the acting is superb david niven kim hunter and especially roger livesey do an outstanding job the use of black and white  color adds to the creative nature of the movie it hasnt been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence it is my favorite movie of all time waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many years is in itself a matter of life and death
825,this is one of the best jodie foster movies out there and largely ignored due to the general publics misconception of it as a teen flick it has wonderful performances particularly a fight scene between jodie and her mother played by a convincing sally kellerman the three girls that play jodies friends are somewhat amateurish but i do think it is worth seeing
826,this film is to my mind the weakest film in the original star wars trilogy for a variety of reasons however it emerges at the end of the day a winner despite all its flaws its still a very good film even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installmentsone problem here is the look of the film which isnt very consistent with the other 2 films i put a lot of that down to the departure of producer gary kurtz the first 2 films have that dirty livedin look with all the technology and so forth in jedi on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned this makes for a much less textured film also the creatures were excessively muppetlike and cutesy at this point it seems like the filmmakers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itselfanother aspect is its lack of originality where star wars created a whole new experience in cinema and empire brought us to alien worlds of swamps ice and clouds jedi lamely recycled the locations of the first film first we are back on the desert planet tatooine and then we are watching them face another death star maybe the emperor couldnt think of anything new but youd think lucas or kasdan could also we have these ewoks who really are just detestable madeformattel teddy bears in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookiefight at the end of star wars if they hadnt run out of cash it just feels like lazy constructionthe most unfortunate aspect of jedi for me is the weak handling of the han solo character whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time trading one liners with the droids instead of a real drama were stuck with the lame pretense that han is still convinced leia loves luke  as if the conclusion of empire where she confessed her love of him had never happened the whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the solo character was not part of this films central story after his rescue ford for his part looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances this is more like a 1990s ford performance bored and looking above the film itself fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes lando an interesting character introduced in empire here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle only hamill given an interesting development in the luke character is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work and to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package ian mcdiarmid does excellent work as well as the emperor the film would sink if he had been too far over the top as he was at times in the new filmsvisually and in terms of effects work other than the clean look of everything its hard to find fault jabba is a very effective animatronic character one of the most elaborate ever constructed the space battles towards the end are very impressiveultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears but on its own it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and imho far superior to any of lucas later productions
827,1985 was a good year for films  maybe even great  but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members11 nominations and not a single title such was the academys disdain for one of their greatest directors and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for schindlers list which is arguably not as good and im halfpolishdont get me wrong schindler was a classic and im not knocking out of africa which won that year either but it was in my mind a class behind this one an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears  and im not a big cryermaybe it was the music superb or the cinematography sumptuous but more likely simply the acting whoopi who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne danny glover who id never heard of before and of course oprahthe rest is history but at the time who knew
828,ok  i admit i think kenny doughty looks amazing in this movie  but beyond his good looks the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable but reasonable plotstarting out were introduced to the three lead females of the movie one a headmistress  very concerned about her image and never married a police officer  with child and a bad ex to go on about the third  a power  status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three exsthey are almost the first wives club and indeed there is much verbal bashing of exs involved as well as some he left the credit card behaviour characters set  the movie continuesmcdowells character the headmistress arrives late at a funeral  where a young organist filling in for the regular player doughty catches her eye what will her two friends say about the ensuing mischief will they live happily ever aftera tissue or two recommended if youre the teary type  the end uplifting but maybe not what youd expect all in all a great movie which stands out amongst the current choices of action special effects and schlock horror
829,i cant believe i am just now seeing this film  i think perhaps i thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated and i avoided roots for the same reason  just as i have yet to see schindlers list  i dont want to be entertained by other peoples pain not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to beso i guess the main thing i noticed about the color purple was that it was not about black people being mistreated by whites the black people were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters  or giving them away to be treated as slaves by their husbands it was painful to watch but everyone redeemed himself in the end and the acting was phenomenal i couldnt believe the character oprah played at the age of 35 and i adore whoopi to start with  she was amazing im so glad i was feeling lousy yesterday afternoon and showtime was running the color purple
830,it starts slowly showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april but dont give up on it nothing much happens but the time passes exquisitely and there are numerous sly jokes my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm which i find hilarious the movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word the scenery is beautiful as is polly walker and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfyingthe movie takes a couple of liberties with the book the biggest being with the arbuthnotbriggsdester business but i actually preferred the movies version of this it may be more sentimental but i felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story and anyway i like sentiment when its well donean excellent movie especially as a date movie during lousy weather
831,highly enjoyable very imaginative and filmic fairytale all rolled into one stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive young and beautiful a kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young these three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting dazzling special effects and some solid sentiment and humour as well stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of claire danes as the stari could gaze at her for quite some time to michelle pfeifferi could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer playing the horrible witch to robert deniro playing a nancyboy air pirate to perfection charlie cox as the lead tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other mark strong jason flemyng and ruppert everett plays their roles well in both life and deathloved this whole thread as well peter otoole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man ricky gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutesnice feet but the real power in the film is the novel by neil gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works
832,andie macdowells facial expressions are great again in this movie when you enter 40 and have been single for a while or all your life you may feel you are wasting away the movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found just anywhere if your antennae is acutely active i liked the quick sexual encounter which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher macdowell her exstudent is cute enough still carrying a crush on his teacher for so long there are some parts that i thought rather unrealistic or unpractical though for example at a scene where the other womens jealousy override and a scene was set up to make andie macdowell dump the young man would a mature police officer the other friend of macdowell allow her friend to do such a sinister act is it so easy for anyone to not stop in front of a car of course accidents happen all the time but i hoped to see the heroine get happily married with the first man she got involved with that was the hardest part to believe for such a beautiful woman to stay single for so long maybe the movie producers are aware of the fact that many romance between an older woman and a younger man do not last for long beside they know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public especially to jealousy women over 40 who are waiting some miracles to happen the sad ending with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet but if the man continued to live would that last for how long nobody knows nonetheless its a movie to make you want to watch it again sometime later a year later maybe
833,magic isnt too strong a word for the spell this film weaves you find yourself relaxing and seeing others in a more benevolent light any movie that has that civilizing an effect on viewers deserves serious attention seldom are we soaked in beauty like this as if that werent enough its funny performances are without exception extraordinary but special mention must be made of the miraculous miranda richardson and the superb josie walker  both open like roseswhy isnt this film on dvd it deserves to live forever
834,i watched it some years ago i remembered it as very mysterious situations and a mixture of melancholic things like the fate of dorothy and the personal future of bogdanovichi turn to watch on my vhs copy and then i was reviewing it more and more nowadays i am waiting for the dvd version at any price pleasethe country and easy listening music is very well chosen from the very first second a bit of blueish but also happyall the characters are great to me with funny situations great acting and a lot of dialogs that have turn this as a cult movie to me and a lot of people i met on the internet or cinema clubs this may not be casualtyi think that the title is a hope about life you have to be happy and laugh as much as possiblei know that this may be a particular comment for the movie but the fact is that i like it very much i think that movie marked me and i will never forget it
835,first off i dislike almost all neil simon movies but there is something about this that is unique that draws me in and i would say it is among the most entertaining comedies i have seen the second time i watched it the connection was clear when did neil simon meet my grandmothers ah afraid they might sue so he changed them into men and how dull would it be if they were only housewives show biz stars is more fun well this is a personal review and my still living grandmother at age 97 she even outlived walter matthaus magnificent impersonation of herwould deny it  but some of you must find resonance in these characterssecondly i have little tolerance for george burns but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances i can recall and my late grandmother even enjoyed it although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film charactervery ethnic in flavor and over the top you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off for me the pleasure lingers
836,this film reminds me of 42nd street starring bebe daniels and ruby keeler when i watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd street especially the character eloise whos a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle like bebe daniels did in 42nd street and another performer gets the part and become a star this film like most race films keeps people watching because of the great entertainment race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era the dancing styles the music dressing styles youll love it this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood it would of had better scenery better filming and more money which would make any movie better but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has i have to say out of all micheauxs films swing is the best the movie features singers dancers actresses and actors who were popular but forgotten today doli armena a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky the sexy hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shameadding further info popular blues singer of the 20s and 30s cora green is the focus of the film shes mandy a good hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women a nosy neighbor played by amanda randolph tells mandy what she seen and heard and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive curvy woman by the name of eloise played hazel diaz a hotcha entertainer in the 30s and a fight breaks out then mandy goes to harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van engle lena provides mandy with a home a job and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith played by hazel i guess shes playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior when cora gets drunk and breaks her leg lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy tall long lanky but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man but after lena threatens him he might shape up there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where cora smith hazel diaz struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but thats not enough she almost gets into a fight with mandy again in between theres great entertainment by chorus girls tap dancers shake dancers swing music and blues singing theres even white people watching the entertainment i wonder where micheaux found them theres even a scene where theres blacks and whites sitting together at the club micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films he should be commended for such a bold movethis movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar micheaux this movie is one of the best of the race film genre its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show businessno these early race films may not be the best cant be compared with hallelujah green pastures stormy weather cabin in the sky carmen jones or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black filmmaking and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black persons eyes these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life be beautiful classy and elegant and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in hollywood most of the actors and actresses of these race films werent the best but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time micheaux and spencer williams couldnt afford nina mae mckinney josephine baker ethel waters fredi washington paul robeson rex ingram and more of the bigger stars so micheaux and other black and white race filmmakers would use nightclub performers in their movies some were good some werent great actors and actresses but i think micheaux and others knew most werent good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent they just wanted their stories told and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films for some true actorsactresses race films were the only type of films they could get work especially if they didnt want to play hollywood stereotypes so i think youll be able to spot the true actorsactresses from the nightclub performers these race films are very historic they could have been lost forever many are lost maybe race films arent the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films didnt start out great in the beginning i think if the race film genre continued it would have better if your looking for great acting most race films arent the ones but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films than watch race films there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast moon over harlem body and soul paradise in harlem keep punching sunday sinners dark manhattan broken strings boy what a girl mystery in swing miracle in harlem and sepia cinderella that not only has good entertainment but good acting
837,although i didnt like stanley  iris tremendously as a film i did admire the acting jane fonda and robert de niro are great in this movie i havent always been a fan of fondas work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time de niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold he gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he cant care for him anymore that will break your heart i wouldnt really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment but i will say you wont see much bette acting anywhere
838,in 2151 in broken bow oklahoma a farmer shoots the klingon klaang with his plasma rifle after the explosion of a methane store in his farm and the klingon is sent to the starfleet hospital the vulcan ambassador soval proposes to unplug the life support system and bring the corpse of klaang to his warrior empire in planet kronos with honor however captain jonathan archer proposes to go with the enterprise in her first voyage and bring back klaang alive to his home planet jonathan invites ensign hoshi sato and dr phlox who is treating klaang to complete his crew and the vulcan subcommander tpol is assigned to participate in the dangerous first mission of enterprise when the equipment of the starship is shutdown klaang is kidnapped by sulibans after a shooting in the hospital after the autopsy of the suliban killed in the shooting captain archer is informed by dr phlox that the alien was actually a mutant altered in a sophisticated genetic engineering process tpol modifies the sensors of the enterprise to track the suliban spacecraft until she reaches planet riger x they investigate and disclose that klaang was a courier bringing an important message about the temporal cold war from the suliban sarin to the leaders of the klingons in kronosin spite of being a huge fan of star trek i have not followed the episodes of enterprise on cable television i have decided to buy the dvd box of the first season and this first episode surprised me the adventure of the first enterprise captain jonathan archer the gorgeous tpol reed mayweather dr phlox hoshi and trip is excellent at least in this pilot i have noted in imdb that this episode is actually divides in two parts but on dvd they are just one therefore my review is valid for both i did not like the music score theme which i found very annoying but this was an exception in this great show my vote is ninetitle brazil broken bow
839,its a colorful slasher movie thats about itit has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies but i never care for such things figuring out whos the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anywaythe death scenes were inventive and gorey bringing back memories of 80s horror movies like friday the 13th another nice thing about this movie is that its hard to pinpoint the surviving girl unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious people who dont like slasher movies wont like this movie as simple as that i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same mb
840,when tsui hark experiments nothing and no one can withstand him legend of zu is possibly 6hours condensed into 1h40 one does not understand all but like at 2001 a space odyssey you also dont have to but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture an extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering astounding rejoicing in the recent years vital severe masterpiece its absolutely perfect as it iswhen tsui hark experiments nothing and no one can withstand him legend of zu is possibly 6hours condensed into 1h40 one does not understand all but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture an extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering astounding rejoicing in the recent years vital severe masterpiece its absolutely perfect as it is 1000000000000010000000000000
841,what could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women theyre supposed to be spying on and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banalbut the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense you can see real people behind the unreal lines and the directing is wonderful each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too longi showed this to several friends in the mid80s because i was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie the friends enjoyed it too
842,had ned kelly been born later he probably would have won a victoria cross at gallipolli such was neds braveryin australia and especially country victoria the name ned kelly can be said and immediately recognised in greta he is still a hero the life blood of the town of jerilderie depends on the tourism he created but in mansfield they still havent forgotten that the three policeman that he murdered were from theremany of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing from the old melbourne gaol where he was hanged to the post office he held up in jerilderie a cell he was once held in in greta is on display in benella and the site of ann jones hotel the station and even the logs where he was captured in glenrowan can be visitedevidence of all the events in the movie except for his love interest can be found all over victoria in police records and even in the sash that ned was awarded with for rescuing dick shelton from drowning none of this is wrong and whats left out would further justify neds actions the horse that ned stole was actually stolen by wild wright the man who ned boxes with after getting out of jail ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldnt have stolen itthe jerilderie letter is more than what has been stated before it is not self justification it is neds biography an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting so go ahead and read it watch the movie and then make up your mind about what ned stood for
843,miike makes a childrens adventure film not unlike the neverending story its actually one of my least favorite of the directors films even the worst miike is better than a good many films though and the great yokai war has a lot in it thats worth recommending its at least as loud and obnoxious as most american kiddie flicks i might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it the dvd includes an english dub but like all of miikes films it can tend to move very slowly that means youve got kind of a weird unevenness where sometimes theres a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters converse the story itself isnt very good either and miikes perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head most of what i liked came from the technical side of things this has to be miikes most expensive movie and it looks fantastic yokai are japanese spirits and they come in all different fantastical forms and the costume designers special effects crew and everyone else involved in the designs just did an outstanding job ive seen the 1968 film this one is supposedly based on yokai monsters spook warfare and the cheesy rubbersuit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more believable entities using stateoftheart makeup and special effects i especially liked the look of one of the bad guys or girls in this case agi who sports dark eye shadow a tight white outfit a white beehive hairdo and a whip shes played incidentally by chiaki kuriyama whom you might remember as lucy lius teenage henchgirl in kill bill vol 1 the hero of the film is played by ryunosuke kamiki who provided voices for miyazakis spirited away and howls moving castle
844,i watched this movie once and might watch it again but although jamie foxx is good in the movie i feel they could have used a less funny character as alvin sanders foxxs scenes for instance in the jail when he is confronted by edgar clenteen david morse are too funny david morse again is a wonderful portrayer of a cop his tough yet mostly quiet features are perfect for his role once again morse meets doug hutchinson bristol in the theater morse ends up coming down hard on hutchinson they are both perfect for this scenario in each film i personally love that quality in a film where actors end up in the same situation as a previous film as these two did in the green mile overall it was a pretty good movie
845,a strong pilot this twohour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for enterprise the prequel to the original star trek series it stumbles a few times into trek convention and clichécandycolored space strippers never seem to go out of style and i can already foresee snickering references to tpol as seven of vulcanbut the ensemble looks strong the characters are welldrawn and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful in different ways than those of earlier later series scott bakula hits the right note as a captain with kirks brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger and i look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer weapons master and communications officer not just a glorified phone operator anymore as supporting players the writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in star trek the next generation deep space 9 and voyager instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift its starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added laterwhich i hope happens because after about a halfdozen episodes more variety will be needed
846,fair dramalove story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new lovethe acting here is good but the film fails in cinematographyscreenplaydirecting and editingthe storyscript is only average at bestthis film will be enjoyed by fonda and de niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious levelit would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding illiteracy
847,this silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences its heros are a couple of dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them down some very silly roads chasing the big murder case you will see these detectives go to every length to solve the crime no nudity but lots of sexual implication slapstick sillinesseverything adolescents go for low budget but very entertaining definite cult classic potential
848,at least for a half hour a week i havent been interested in anything on the big 3 networks abccbsnbc in years all of the lions are interesting although larry can get annoying at times i really like the middle earth action figures they bring in with hunter most of the other characters are interesting as well the sideshow of siegfried and roy is entertaining at times too the animation is top notch and definitely the best cg that has been done on a weekly tv show usually when they hire big names to star in a show theyre trying to hide a poor script or characters not entirely true in this show though theres a couple characters that were weak and improved by the voice acting but overall the characters stand on their ownthis is definitely for 16 and up theres nothing here that most kids havent already heard before though and most of the jokes would probably just fly right over their heads its definitely not as crude and edgy as south park but does bring some of the same bash everyone feel to it one example is that it makes fun of both dick cheney and barbara streisand at the same time in one episode father of the pride and other dreamworks productions like shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of animaniacs pinky and the brain and freakazoid its the same type of humor grown up it may not be as witty as spielbergs classic tv series but its still goodi hope that it finishes this season off well and is renewed for future seasons otherwise i may never find a reason to watch the big 3 again
849,this is a complex film that explores the effects of fordist and taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations there are constant references to assembly line production where workers are treated as cogs in a machine overseen by managers wielding clipboards controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed and firing workers stanley who meet all criteria as his supervisor says are always on time are hard workers do good work but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake this system destroys families  stanley has to send his father to a nursing home where he quickly dies after stanley loses his job iris daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant references are made to the fact that now with declining wages both partners need to work the implication being that theres nobody left at home to care for the kids iris husband is dead from an illness and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care iris brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift andor teeth job even the working class with no stake in conventional bourgeois notions of perfection and beauty buy into them the one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail presumably hes also black and black men suffer disproportionally high incarceration rates she remarks that he like her is doing time  her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slavestanley however still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of fordist capitalism he cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his fathers traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy  he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract as iris brother in law does suggesting that he married the wrong sister he does not as iris says conform to the workeatsleep routine of everyone else rather he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way in a sort of bauhaus ideal this was the dream of early modernists and 1920s socialists such as the bauhaus  to use technology to provide for all basic needs allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations he is also outside of traditional gender relations he cooks he cleans he cares for his family and he knows how to iron iris on the other hand lives in a traditionally male role  shes a factory worker the mains source of income for her extended family and she brings stanley into the public realm traditionally offlimits to women by teaching him to read and write she gives him access to the world of knowledge also traditionally gendered maleliteracy here is used as a metaphor for the traditionally masculine public realm and the systems of circulation monetary vehicular cultural that enable participation in the public realm without this access stanley is feminized  the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning he is excluded from all regular circulations unable to participate in the monetary cant open a bank account in the vehicular cant get a drivers license cant ride the bus and in the social he asks if he exists if he cant write his nameafter learning to read he grabs books on auto repair farming and spirituality the bible the word of god is therefore relativized placed on the same value plane as howto books in fact organized religion in general is only very occasionally present  the bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find stanley and iris having sex it is however acknowledged as a moral force  iris clearly a character devoted to living a good life mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatchingonce able to read he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan a car and a house taking his place at the head of the family the breadwinner presumably hes an industrial designer dreaming up products that will require others enduring the drudgery of the assembly line to produce this ending probably the only bit of conventional hollywood in the film is so incongruous with all that has come before that i at least wonder if it wasnt forced in by some studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feelgood ending and its potential effect on the bottom linenow that according to the pundits weve comfortably moved on to postindustrial capitalism the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period nevertheless its highly recommended  at least if you want to exercise your brain disregard the ending and its close to a perfect 10
850,although i have not seen this miniseries in over twenty years i can still remember how the balance between characterplot and tale of marvelous adventures succeeded the use of special effects was restrained making a more poetic rather than literal telling of the story the two versions ive seen were dubbed english and frenchbut the actors appear to speak their own language not just italian so there is a synchronization problem it does not spoil the story telling among the cast irene pappas as penelope is the most recognizable to north americans recommended to all followers of odysseus ever returning
851,13 days to glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the mexican viewpoint the major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor james arness played the part of jim bowie persuasively the rest of the name actors in the cast brian keith davy crocket and lorne greene sam houston were too oldraul julia played general antonio lopez de santa anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle the scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military santa anna was within his prerogatives to be angry raul julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scenekathleen york was an impressive susannah dickinson a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage however kathleen york might have been reminded that as dickinsons hailed from pennsylvania they probable dis not sound very southron
852,what a delightful movie the characters were not only lively but alive mirroring real every day life and strife within a family each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friendsthe story has a truetolife flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops the script does a good job of capturing the common emotions actions and reactions of the characters to conflict opinion and resolvenot an epic but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones plenty of knowing head nods and ahhh moments to share and enjoy
853,the penultimate collaboration between director anthony mann and star james stewart excluding the few days mann worked on night passage before parting company with the star under less than amicable circumstances the far country belies its mainstream look to offer another portrait of an embittered man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption fighting it every step of the way this time hes a cattle driver whose response to labour problems  challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail  results in his cattle being confiscated by john mcintires larcenous judge of the roy bean school of law and order stealing them back and taking them across the canadian border he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claimswhile its no great surprise which way stewart turns at the end hes a surprisingly callous critter along the way even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not warning a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance because its not his problem for most of the film theres really only a hairs breadth between him and mcintire something the judge recognises immediately revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as hes genially planning to lynch him in many ways the townspeople who put their faith in him probably recognise it too  despite their appeals to his deadandburied better nature theres an unspoken acknowledgement that the only person who can stand up to the judge is someone almost as bad as he isas usual with mann theres an exceptional use of high country locations though for once the final showdown takes place on level ground and the film is almost perfectly cast with strong support from walter brennan harry morgan and ruth roman though corinne calverts young romantic interest veers to the irritating sadly the great cinematography of the canadian rockies is done few favours by a distinctly average dvd transfer with only the theatrical trailer as an extra
854,although stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances it is certainly not when i saw the movie i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies and i was right stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film it has this magical aura from the beginning to the very end of the movie the storyline is well written  and it keeps you on the edge of your seat like every tale  it has some short of morality therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers wont take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey we also know that the true love is yvaine and not victoria  the material girl who is shallow and manipulative i have to give extra credits to claire danes she literally shines in this movie her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character moreover she and cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable the rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make stardust an interesting and high classed movieoverall  the movie is fantastic the locations magical and the plot interestingi was very disappointed that the film didnt get nominated for more awards i have to give at least 910 stars for this
855,stairway to heaven is a outstanding invention of movie making probably never duplicated i rank it with the wizard of oz and african queen although it is a totally different type of movie than african queen stairway to heaven is a psychodrama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that to my knowledge are totally unique for example there is the combination of bw and color footage  as in oz but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple  but beautiful  effect achieved in oz in stairway the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerfulanother brilliant aspect of stairway is the concept of time and how it is used here how could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still  literally and then there is the stairway itselfif you have any imagination at all you will agree with me stairway to heaven is a true gem
856,definitely one of my favourite movies the story is good acting is great all technicals especially cinematography are sharp and the script is cleverheath ledger is terrific as edward ned kelly he is gripping as the legendary outlaw and is supported well by geoffrey rush naomi watts and orlando bloom all action sequences are on pointthe film is edgeofyour seat stuff right up to to the end one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in and makes no mistake herean excellent film all round
857,katherine heigl marley shelton denise richards david boreanaz even before i knew what this film was about these names were enough to draw me in gorgeous talented and popular these are performers to look out forok where do i start we already know what the film is about five beautiful girls being targeted by a romantic serial slasher a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago his trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards maggotinfested chocolates and a bleeding nose his weapon of choice well take a pick  axe knife electric powerdrill bow and arrow hot iron etc ok so basically its a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexualityhorror movies arent supposed to be shakespeare but im not gonna go there i love horror movies but not all of them this one i adore its up there with some of my other favorites its funny sexy and scary the killers mask is childishly creepy and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky the acting is topnotch denise richards marley shelton and david boreanaz are a lot of fun i really did wish to see much much more of katherine heigl i am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon jessica capshaw is a very capable actress and jessica cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in urban legend 2 the smaller parts were also good hedy buress was a hoot bleedmedrycom and that younger version of denise richards looked frightfully like herhighlights every death scene had a particular distinction to it the creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue the hottub scene while ludicrous was well done and the audiovisual maze was sinister the soundtrack is great with creepy music and some fine alternative tuneslowpoint i felt as though the killer wasnt featured enough we barely saw the mask and it wasnt featured at all during the climax i also thought the climax was really unfocused but fun nonethelessthe twist at the end wasnt that big of a surprise but im really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole explaining killer routinei dont like to tell people which movies they should see but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that i thought was really worth seeing then valentine would be itmy rating 1010 bullseye
858,the matador is a strange film its main character julian played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by brosnan is not your typical hero julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late midlife crises having spent 22 years in the profession of cold blooded murder he now finds himself stressed out and desperately lonely and so after a chance meeting at a bar with danny greg kinnear he latches on and begins a halting awkward friendship danny the quintessential nice guy is dealing with some stuff in his own life and truth be told could use a friend as well the two make an unexpected connection and danny sticks around to hear julians story even after learning the unsavory truth about julians workmatador approaches a subject not completely unheard of in cinema the antihero assassin films like assassins and grosse pointe blank come to mind but matador differs in several key ways first of all the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you and second unlike most antihero films matador makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character julians job is simply presented as an it is what it is kind of thing this is unusual given that 9999 of us would consider killing for money horrific and yet this unorthodox approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic although we dont like to admit it almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough maybe even murder did julians victims deserve to die who is paying to have people killed who knows the movie never deals with these questions the focus is on julian and his stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship if you read about someone like julian in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity sympathy for the devil i guessbrosnans take on julian is well done and deeply unsettling he doesnt completely divorce himself from his james bond good looks and smooth charm but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix weird or crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance it keeps you guessing about his grasp on his sanity and how it will affect those around him its a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while he plays but it works the films only other major role that of danny is not nearly as meaty kinnear turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular joe with a regular joe life and problemsthe film doesnt really have any huge shocks or m night shyamalan twists but i wasnt able to guess the ending and it felt satisfying it doesnt have any deep philosophical or spiritual insights and yet it felt very human and it didnt have any heart pounding car chases or gun battles and yet i thought the pacing was well done and i was never bored maybe the only real message here is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another and how those needs have no moral prerequisites even a murderer needs friends and even good people can be friends with bad people its a comment on the strange random world we live in a good film worth seeing
859,screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in new york city peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picturehe reveres themyet audrey hepburn is naturally put a notch above the others because after all shes the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior he shoots her in loving closeups gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hardboiledsoftboiled ben gazzara and allows her room to sparkle throughout the loveconnections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing though i did tire of john ritters tvstyled klutziness colleen camp dorothy stratten and the grounded earthysensual patti hansen are all exciting to watch but its really hepburns valentine and she absolutely glows  from 
860,i finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of show people i cannot comment any more than what previous viewers have stated and to the characters plot and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words seeing the cameo outofcharacter appearances of so many mgm silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself i really like the scene where marion davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie patricia pepoire make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees marion davies but it is something to the effect of i dont think i like her pop the corn pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history enjoy
861,of course the plot script and especially casting are strong in the film so many fine things to see one aspect i liked especially is the idea of the antagonistluzhinis turturrosexmentor working his evil on the sidelines his chess opponentan italian dandy in three piece and caneturns out to be a real gent and a truly fine chess player to his credit the opponent nobly goes along with the plan at the end to complete the final game for the championship posthumously luzhin has taken a flyer out a windowsad but so releasing to himby way of the unstable genius widow emily watson in death then because of the gallantry of an honorable chess master luzhins defence which he worked out in a late moment of lucidity is allowed to be played the italian gent commends the play and calls it brilliant talk about a dramatic end game
862,having ran across this film on the fox movie channel on a lazy friday afternoon i can think of no better way to spend a lazy friday evening then putting in my two cents worth especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it doesnt every movie good or bad deserve more than four comments and this movie isnt bad at allthe first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like april love is to remember the era from which it came in this case the late fifties films were pretty much a happy medium back then the cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen technicolor films in order to pry people away from the gray glare of the evil medium in a box called television i dont know how many people were pried away from the boob tube to see this one but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutesteen idol pat boone plays nick conover a young teen sent to live with his aunt henrietta jeanette nolan and uncle jed arthur oconnell out in the country after being put on probation for stealing a car it seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son jed jrso uncle jed seems has lost his zest for living aunt henrietta is hoping that nick being on the farm will somehow bring jed out of his doldrums story lines like this being what they are jed and nick dont really care for each other too much of course jed then proceeds to meet up with the neighbors fran dolores michaelsand liz shirley jonestempleton immediately jed develops a crush on fran and of course i dont have to tell you that liz develops a crush on jed then theres the matter of uncle jeds horse a trotter who has turned wild and wont let anyone handle him since the death of jed jr you could probably fill in everything that happens from that point on your own seeing as how there are no real surprises doesnt matter though youll enjoy yourself anywayonce you get over the image of squeaky clean pat boone as a supposedly bad boy youll have no trouble with the rest of the film considering that boone does turn in a surprisingly good performance as nick certainly the role doesnt require much depth but still its a nicely done job when you would least expect it as jed arthur oconnell is the perfect choice for the role in the early going he is unreachable and cold but as he slowly warms up to nick we see that hes really a pretty good guy jeannette nolan is a lot of fun as henrietta who is constantly playing the part of mediator between jed and nick shirley jones takes a break from rodgers and hammerstein and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents as liz shes gorgeous to look at great to listen to and quite funny at times dolores michaels as fran who is a bit more on the wild side is equally entertainingthe best thing about april love is that there is not a true mean conniving character of any sort on the screen not one true villain in the whole thing everybody is so darn likable you cant help but enjoy the film i truthfully find it quite refreshing sort of like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends think of it as the old andy griffith show with musical numbers a little more plot and wide screen technicolor the songs are a mixed bag with the title song april love being the best of them another thing i really liked is that they didnt fall back on using blue screen backdrops during the horse racing sequences and they quite a bit more entertaining and exciting because of it as a matter of fact youll find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see they didnt skimp in that department the chemistry between jones and boone is good best of all is how the dislike between nick and jed is portrayed as each try in some way to gain the others respectthis movie will never be confused with great cinema yet sometimes instead of going to disneyland one just needs a nice outing in the park and thats what april love ismy grade b
863,i love the way that this game can make you literally jump out of your seat while you are playing it the way that the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit its very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that its just a game and your not really there the sound effects and audio are amazing there are a lot of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not you get this stone that can knock back enemies while you recover mana to blast your foes with even more magic the best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really jumpy and afraid of what might lurk around the next corner or what might jump out behind you if you want to get the full experience try playing it with head phones on
864,this is no arthouse film its mainstream entertainment lots of beautiful people ta and action i found it very entertaining its not supposed to be intellectually stimulating its a fun film to watch jesse and chace are funny too which is just gravy definitely worth a rentalso in summary id recommend checking it out for a little friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl if she likes to see other girls get it onthe villains are good too vinnie corey large the hatian guy from heroes very nasty villains
865,i was one of about 200 people that was lucky enough to see an early sneak of this filmstardust follows tristan a young man on a quest to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her the only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall a doorway between england and a magical kingdom known as stormholdthis film was just a joy to watch it has something in it for everyone all of the action scenes are played out beautifully and the comedy is spread out through the film making it funny without being corny if i had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be the princess bride a classicall the performances are outstanding the beautiful claire danes makes you love her in her portrayal of yvaine the trusting naive star and under rated michelle pfeiffer delivers a stellar over the top performance as larniabut the performance to talk about is robert de niroin every scene that he is in hands down he steals the showif you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film guys dont get turned off by the description there is enough action comedy and not to mention lots of eye candy with claire danes and michelle pfeiffer to keep you entertained throughout the cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the filmnothing about the film seems forced
866,the story of ned kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand and this film is no exception what ensures ned kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him during several battles he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce indeed it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the victorian police who noticed he hadnt plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged the story has been told in schools and histories of australia for so long that some permutations of the story have ironically become boring the more the stories try to portray kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster the less people pay attentionwhich is where this adaptation of our sunshine a novel about the kelly legend excels rather than attempting to portray a ned kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore the film quickly establishes him as a human being indeed the reversal of the popular legend showing the corruption of the victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd here ned kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it no i am not making that up about the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the irish versus english mentality of the battles while the kelly gang were distinctly irish australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly a scene with some chinese migrants highlights thisheath ledger does an amazing job of impersonating australias most notorious outlaw it is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching ledger and not kelly himself orlando bloom has finally found a role in which he doesnt look completely lost without his bow and geoffrey rushs appearance as the leader of the police contingent at glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state but it is naomi watts appearing as julia cook who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film although the film basically implies that cook was essentially the woman in ned kellys life but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here indeed a lot of the films hundred and ten minutes feels more freezedried than explorative once the element of police corruption is established in fact the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushedunfortunately most of the films strengths are not capitalised upon rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits ditto for watts and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins i can only conclude that another fifteen or even thirty minutes of footage might have fixed this but that leads to the other problem in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact one scene manages to do the speechmaking thing well but unfortunately it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while if one were to believe the impression that this film creates a matter of weeks even days passes between the time that ned kelly becomes a wanted man on the sayso of one corrupt policeman and the infamous shootout at glenrowan annoyingly the trial and execution of ned kelly is not even depicted here simply referred to in subtitles before the credits rollthat said aside from some shaky camerawork at times ned kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts and it has a good beginning for that reason i rated it a seven out of ten other critics have not been so kind so if youre not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout then you might be better off looking elsewhere especially if you want a more factual account of ned kellys life
867,this movie is very cool if youre a fan of tsui hark and chinese fantasy films you should love this this film is the asian lord of the rings a high fantasy story based in actual chinese mythology i realize many critics have called this film plotless i think they probably have zero knowledge of chinese mythology if you liked stormriders or warriors of heaven  earth this one should be right up your alley this film is still very difficult to find in the us even though it was purchased for us distribution along with crouching tiger hidden dragon and iron monkey well worth the search this dvd is also worthy of owning
868,this is 2009 and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had 31 years ago it connects a pretty wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing to be clutteredclothes and music might have changed over time but in the end this is a story that will never lose its uptodateness and especially this movie does the job pretty well of course it is cheesy at times but very touching as welljodie fosters performance is striking and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier moviesdont miss this one
869,im sick of people whining about ewoks true theyre not the best thing that ever happened to star wars but they did happen so deal with it besides they are cute and i dont care if theyre marketable yubb nubbthis movie always leaves me in tears its perfect the end could not be better im excited for the phantom menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from luke to anakin i love how he is revealed at the end  it would be too unresolved any other way so those of you who are complaining that vaders helmet was removed take a moment to think about it its very effective vader the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years is finally revealed as a sicklooking man he is not entirely machine  hes vulnerablei dont know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in a new hope they all do so well they are believable characters hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development fisher does a fine job being a female role model i mean come on she killed jabba even when so many others had failed harrison ford  need i say morethe music is once again brilliant its so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie the best climax is when luke shouts nooo and jumps out to fight his father in the final battle john williams is nothing short of a genius what an amazing manalready the movie has so much more meaning for me because of episode i i cant wait to finally see it in the theatres can i wait and then watch the original trilogy yet againbravo
870,in watching how the two brothers interact and feed off of each other through the whole movie makes me personally happy to live in the rural area much like they did in the movie i have watched this movie countless times and have the book right beside my bible after watching the movie i agree that this is one of the few movies that does a book justice i strongly recommend anyone that has the chance to go to montana to fish or be outdoors to do so it is amazing i can not think of anyone else that could play the role better than brad pitt do yourself justice and watch one of the better movies in the modern movie era strongly recommend and as a guide for fishing trips in both montana and wyoming do not try to learn how to fly fish from the scenes of the movie because although it looks great on the film you have no idea how much practice and skill fishing like that actually takes thank you for listening watch this movie please if you would like a long sad movie
871,neil simons the odd couple set up a model for many of his later plays felix unger and oscar madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original the former being picky and neat the latter being slovenly and loose simon would rewrite less successfully the play in the 1990s as the new odd couple with female roommates he made it a mixed couple a woman with her daughter and a man in the goodbye girls he also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with the sunshine boys a broadway hit starring jack alberson and sam levine as al lewis and willie clark the aged semiretired vaudevillians here the apartment problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who cant stand each other the 1976 film starred walter matthau as willie and george burns as alin actuality al probably does not think totally badly of willie  willie is pathological on the subject of al first al had little habits such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter t and slightly jabbing willie with his index finger on stage secondly al retired when his wife died willie was not ready to retire and has been forcing his nephew and agent ben richard benjamin to try to get him jobs in commercials but willie cant remember lines unless they are funny and keeps flubbing them so he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercialben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about american comedy he does bring al to see willie and the sparks begin flying as neither can figure out what the other is doing and this is just in rehearsal on top of that willie is insisting on changes minor ones but they throw off al such as saying enter when al knocks on the door the initial rehearsal is a failure but ben manages to get them to the taping of the show the question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will willie wring als neckthe three leads matthau burns and benjamin do very well with the oneliners frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter example chest painsim getting chest pains uncle willie every thursday i come here and get chest pains so come on fridays benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle although matthaus rough outer shell makes it difficult he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville matthau has a little better grasp on reality at first than burns who seems senile by his repeating himself  but in actuality matthaus sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly burns is not senile  he takes things slowly but he seems far happier in accepting his retirementi call this a final voyage of discovery for our modern lewis and clark al and willie transcend their old skits as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought even the irascible willie admits that al may be to him a pain in the ass but he was a funny manburns was not the original choice for the part of al lewis supposedly dale of the team smith and dale jack benny was benny probably would have done a good job but illhealth forced him out he died in 1975 burns whose last involvement in any film was in the solid gold cadillac in 1956 as the narrator turned in such a fine performance that he got the oscar for best supporting actor and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as oh god oh god you devil and going in style he died in 1996 age 100 having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife gracie allan

873,the 14 yearold in me is immensely happy that theyre now able to make really good looking fantasy movies and that theyre all the rage what with lord of the rings harry potter and the chronicles of narnia making loads of cash at the box office this year will see and already has seen several more most notably the golden compass which has the most exciting trailer ive seen this year stardust based on a novel by neil gaiman showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep i saw no previews for it only a couple of commercials the critical reaction is kind of blah i wouldnt even have seen it if not for the fact that i have to wait on a friend to see the bourne ultimatum and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend well if youll forgive the horrible pun the stars must have been rightly aligned because i went to see stardust and i loved it its not a huge movie like lord of the rings the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest the hero sets out to look for a fallen star filled with obstacles but within that basic outline the story is lively and imaginative its simply aiming to be a lot of fun and a charming little romance and it succeeds wonderfully there were a lot of big films this summer but none of them were nearly as fun as this one theres a lot going on but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent it isnt a masterpiece but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like the princess bride has though i dont like it quite as much as the earlier film a lot of fun to be had here if youre a fan of the genre
874,i thought this movie was really really great because in india cinemas nowadays all you see is skin music and bad actingin this movie you can see some tradition ethnicity and at least some decencyalthough some parts were a little dramatic guess what that is what indian cinema is all about after watching this movie at least you dont get a headache from all the loud overrated music or any violence its just the truth it teaches about love and of course caring for the person you love throughout lifei think it was an amazing moviekids can watch it without a doubt and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be indias sure profoundnessuntil all these rap hits miniskirts and skin showing became a part of it
875,more eeriness and dark secrets released in the final parts of lars von triers fantastic horror satire the kingdom much more is revealed and the ending just leaves you begging for more plus a great performance from udo kier in a more substantial role
876,the film version of alice walkers hugely emotive and influential 1983 novel written largely as letters from the central character celie to god was a massive oscar success and rightly soin the role of the abused and awakened celie whoopi goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles not far behind her was oprah winfrey as sofia the fiery woman tamed by fate others in the cast fleshed out the characters walker had introduced so clearly on the page  danny glover as albert celies abusive husband margaret avery as shug a force of change for the good willard pugh and rae dawn chong as harpo and squeak susan beaubian as corrine the preachers wife and the muchmissed carl anderson otherwise best known as judas in the 1973 film of jesus christ superstar as preacher samuelbeautifully paced and sensitively written the color purple does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a featurelength drama
877,if you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a raf lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of may 1945 is somewhat unlikely since german air defences were as lively as adolph hitler on that day but this isnt a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience and i guess a character being killed in literally the last hours of the war adds to the poignancy  in fact youd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect  beauty and soul of powell and pressburgers masterpiece  the scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today  again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made  raf bomber command lost 58000 men during the war  the same number that america lost in nam but during a shorter period and a far  far smaller pool of active combatants  theres no atheists in a fox hole and i doubt if youd lost a relative during the conflict youd view material atheism as being a sensible thing  when richar attenboroughs young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who didnt survive the war  also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 193945 there seems to be very few people from germany passing through the pearly gates  its obvious nazis dont go to heaven the plot itself where dashing young pilot peter carter arguing for his life in front of a celestial court wouldnt have had much appeal to me if it wasnt for the subtext  you see a matter or life and death is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the british empire as its replaced by american ambitions  theres little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of american history and culture  one is the ethnic mix of america  even today many britons think that the usa is overwhelmingly composed of white anglo saxon protestants when in fact only 51 of americans are  white european   the film rightly contains a scene where a multitude of different races confess  i am an american  as peter is judged by abraham farlan  an anglophobe who was the first revolutionary killed by british forces in the american war of independence  as for the  special relationship  between britain and america  what special relationship  powell and pressburger know their history when it comes to britain and america  they obviously know their future too so remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present  its strange  beautiful  poignant and clever but most of all its a film that would never ever work if it were made in the last 40 years  can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a british soldier killed in iraq 
878,this program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy i cant get it out of my head i find as i get older i am drawn to the wrinklies who get things done and these four are excellent in their endeavors some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our pc world wed never be able to do it in real life i always learn something from the shows but if you like mystery drama comedy and a little forensic work youll love this show it reminds me of quincy me in one way and barney miller in another the way they work and interreact with each other they screw up a lot but they get the job done and thats what counts
879,genteel softly spoken drama from steven spielberg was his first real venture into this genre a departure from his normal adventurefantasy fare it paved the way for his 1993 success schindlers listbased upon alice walders pulitzer prize winning novel the story concerns a young girls arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister nettie while the plot  about compassion abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds  is often powerful and moving it loses its way through the fault of continuity and menno meyjes scrambling screenplay the color purple is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame this lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in miss walkers novel a real shame that maestro spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a directorperformances are strong throughout with whoopi goldberg making a debut  which shes never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment  as the heart broken celie who just yearns to be loved danny glover lends solid support though his moses was a superior turn for him in places in the heart the standout showing comes from the unheralded oprah winfrey as miss sophia the single minded fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising upper class white woman good support also from margaret avery adolph caesar and rae dawn chongquincy jones  coproducer with spielberg kathleen kennedy and frank marshall  has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion editing from michael kahn is sound as always while director of photography allen daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious southern scenerythis true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questionswednesday january 15 1997  video
880,well i had seen they all laughed when it came out ineurope around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it i ve just seen it again on tape almost twenty years after bogdanovich has a true heartfelt tenderness over his characters and a kind sympathy which is difficult not to feel also excellent comedians and actors good lines all over and for everyone and pretty good editing too i laughed and smiled all the time just as we all do at times go get it
881,im 14 so you probably would think i have never heard of george burns or walter matthau or anyone like that boy are you wrong i had heard that george burns was in this movie and that he won an academy award for it i have been a fan of george burns since i was ten i saw the movie oh god recently and loved it this one was also very awesome george burns did a great job so did walter matthauthis is the first time ive ever seen him perform and even though they had really small roles phyllis diller and steve allen did a good job that special they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done let me say this if you are a fan of george burns or walter matthau you should see this movie right away
882,ill come clean the only reason i even found out about this dvd was because dominic monaghan is a favorite actor of mine when i heard the title of the film i thought it was going to bedifferent perhaps in not such a good waybut i was wrong after reading what few reviews were out there about this short i was actually excited about seeing it i sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later needless to say i was not disappointedthe film follows jack a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality and what is all in his head i wont give away what happens but i will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in its realismthe directing is fantastic focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thoughtprovoking momentsall in all i give this great film 9 out of 10 for going far beyond what i thought any short could achieve
883,i like ghost stories good ghost stories of bumps in the night voices that cannot be explained now ive see many of them as special efx have a ever more grip on todays films some times to find a real gem  you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories now this one very rare  pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called  the new house  was one of the most scariest films i ever saw it was on once in 1972i was only 9but nothing since then even compared to it with all the remake going on in hollywood some one should do this one  as is  with no more special efx than the original this episode was down right creepy as hell im lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find the only other 2 ghost stories to even come close was the original  the haunting  and george c scott in  the changling   wish someone would do more ghost stories like these
884,this is an excellent film with an extraordinary cast and acting i was very disappointed with the academy awards when this didnt get the oscar for best film and for best actress woopi goldberg it certainly deserved it in any case take a look at it i am sure you will enjoy it very much
885,the first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is beauty beauty is all around in actors play andie is superb as always in well designed shots and in authors red line idea  the lovei think the kennys character is the only white spot in these three womens otherwise boring and predictable life his interaction makes andies character living as entertaining as it could possibly be when hes gone it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desiresthe fact that andie successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad instead it shows that life prevails in any forms even in this small british village which is shown perfectlyanother reason i love this movie is that it is so british in all ways  all that houses and fags and accents  and andie again is doing superb job it is a shame that this movie got such low marks 10 out of ten
886,my first child was born the year this program came out and i played the record album for the boys every christmas thereafter when the cd came out i bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start familiesit invariably becomes their favorite christmas album i recently found several dvds made on dvdr from video tapes probably for sale on ebay the one i bought was an excellent copy and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years there are some songs on the show that were not on the album and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show but both the cd and dvd will stay in our library as the best christmas entertainment ever
887,the opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness  the altered version of the archers logo the introductory disclaimer the way the camera pans over the cosmos its strange to think that its a wonderful life came out in the same year no great coincidence the 1940s was awash with heavenandearth films but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered something best passed over in silence when placed next to alfred junges visionit continues to look great all the way through as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us im not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general one of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other not so here powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if its the most natural thing in the world a mere change of palettes both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their ownas for the story  this may be pressburgers best script or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events other than that its tight yet with more going on than i can possibly allude to here was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary or both perhaps carter dreamt up a fantasy that was as it so happened true everyone says were meant to neither ask nor answer this question but i dont see why im sure we are meant to ask the question the film even gives us clues as to what the answer is  indeed the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions the fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well doesnt mean that this shouldnt occupy us as well there is as ive said before a lot going onconsider the scene in which abraham farlan heavens prosecuting lawyer plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match and contemptuously says the voice of england 1945 dr reeves the defence acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment and then produces one of his own a blues song from america which farlan listens to as though hes got a lemon in his mouth reeves looks smugsnobbery well i dont see why its snobbish to condemn blues music  and thats not what powell and pressburger are doing anyway as the song is being played we get a shot of the american soldiers listening to it several of them nod their heads to the rhythm perfectly at home they dont find it incomprehensible theres something valuable about the song and neither reeves nor farlan knows what it is reeves probably realises as much all english audiences and all australian indian etc audiences as well know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast too and that while reeves understands that he is unable to explain it to farlan  hence the blues broadcast which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else its a clever sceneone last thing i found david niven a bit cold without the charisma he would acquire later in his career but even so i dont think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began as this one did
888,once in a while you come upon a movie that defines your values and shows you the true depth of human emotions leaving you drained vivah is just that  maybe more after watching ddlj saajan and lamhey i really thought that bollywood has reached its pinnacle and will never come up with anything like that  ever boy was i wrong i went to the store to buy some groceries and decided to pick this movie up along with the new don just so i can compare the great ab with shahrukh  although the decision is already made in my mind after debating whether i should waste almost 3 hours on a meaningless movie i decided to watch it realizing i had nothing else to do when i saw the rating of u instead of an a i was happy that at least it is something where i dont have to watch scantily clad women with bad acting skills doing nothing but dancing on every opportunity they get and making out with every guy to show that they have more skills in bed than a hollywood b actress for the first 5 minutes or so i thought i would again be subjected to meaningless story with bad acting after all everyone who has seen shahid kapor know that he as never gained his fame as an accomplished actor boy  was i wrong about this movie this movie grabbed my interest after the first 5 minutes and would never let it go it was a great movie with a good storyline about the vanishing traditions of our society i liked not only that the director was brave enough to make a movie where younger generation might not relate to the concept of arranged marriage but also that he did it with a conviction that it is the right thing to do i have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good i felt that the acting was great and even though the music score might not be considered the best ever it was still very very good the good thing is this music will grow on people with time like it did with me after the i watched that movie a second time the other good thing is that thee songs are not pushed into the script as we have all seen in so many movies these songs actually tell a big part of the story and are certainly a welcome addition just like ajay devgan went from being a joke to a great actor after company and salman found his groove after hum aapkey hain kaun this movie will help shahid kappor jump to being of the better actors and entertainers in bollywood this is the first movie of his in which i like him and his role he acted well and adjusted to being the nice good looking young rich kid yes you will not find him playing basketball and scoring every point on a dunk like you saw shahrukh in ddlj even though he is shown to be an indian in england  both countries not big on basketball by the way he does come across as very believable as a person who holds true to his values amrita rao for the first time came across as someone to be remembered in all her other movies she was competing with big faces which was actually hindering her no one knew how good of an actress she really is until they watch this movie some of the scenes in which she has to cry especially towards the end really shows her knowledge and depth of acting although she has been in another movies she is most memorable in this one i think this movie will and should do wonders for her move over rani  there is finally another girl who if given a decent chance to work with good directors can grab the torch from you she is beautiful with a great voice and has a face that exudes complete innocence oh having almost 0 body fat does not hurt either yes people i will challenge you find even 01 fat on her and unlike so many others like sonali she can actually act too i thought i will never be enamored by anyones beauty after madhuri and early kajol but she completely changed that shahid and amrita worked very well together and their relationship fitted their characters and they both did an excellent job although i was waiting for shahid to turn into a girl like salman did every time he uttered hum aapkey hain kaun when i finished watching this movie it left me so emotionally drained that i decided to watch this movie again right away yes right away i have never ever done that not even with ddlj but this movie just had something that had to be understood again and again i will probably watch this movie a third time over the weekend just so i can watch and relive the traditions we all grew up with i miss those times where families sat down and had fun when parents had time for their kids and where kids respected what their parents believed in i know a lot of people think that movie does not portray real life but deep down dont we all want it to happen the families thee tradition the love and respect this is what this movie will remind all of us of i can assure you it is an extremely well made movie which you will enjoy i am sure some young people will not like this movie but if you are over 28 i doubt that you will be one of them
889,it is not every films job to stimulate you superficially i will take an ambitious failure over a massmarket hit any day while this really cant be described as a failure the sum of its parts remains ambiguous that indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again this is a challenging provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly the problem with the movie is in its structure its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up just as a second ending is tacked on though everything is technically dazzling the movie is exactly too long by that unit the longdelayed climax of leos awakening comes about 20 minutes lategreat cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas the compositing artifice is provocative and engaging a character is rearprojected but his own hand in the foreground isnt the world depicted is deliberate treacherous and absurd keep your eyes peeled for a memorable technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw dropthe compositions are stunning whomever chose to release the out of print videotape in the pan  scan format must have never seen it where is the dvdit is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review you should see it at least once you get the sense that von trier bit off more than he could chew but this movie ends up being richer for it i suspect he is familiar with hitchcocks foreign correspondent in which devious europeans also manipulate an american dupe and several welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does all von trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies after zentropa von trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary overrated unnuanced sap like breaking the waves and dancer in the dark
890,takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love visitor q gozu izo ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think hes succeeding still this was the first of his films id seen him take that direction so i was nervous of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i didgreat yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child neverending story labyrinth return to oz etc i enjoyed those films because they didnt treat kids like theyre stupid and this one doesnt either the dark underlying morals are there but its also as silly as any kids film should be i personally wasnt bothered by the cgi and prosthetics i feel like they fit well and dont think kids will noticeif you are a die hard takashi miike fan you may not like this one but i suggest giving it a shot it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones which is very reassuringto those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one i suggest these other miike films zebraman the happiness of the katakuris sabu and the bird people in china good job takashi miike 810 stars
891,for anyone whos judged others at first meeting here is the perfect tutorial on depth of character the grumpy old lady has a soft thoughtful heart  and needs new friends the flighty unsure ditsy dame who makes inappropriate uncomfortable comments  sees deep into your soul and has pure love for all the cold prim proper neglected wife has passion simmering that could boil over at any minute  given the right setting the perfect beauty  rich sweet partying pursued by throngs  wants peace quiet and love without possessiveness by taking the time to look beyond the surface you will find treasures in everyday life from the least expected sources all it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment
892,this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made it is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what exactlys going on the film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers commercials contests one enters by mail and a host of other innovations besides what other movies have cameos by martin luther king jr to decipher the film hunt down the directors book entitled i was curious itll all become clear its a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking a triumph now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color other than whitethe white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible
893,oh its so cool to watch a silent classic once in while director vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy at least for 1928 cameo as himself the story is about having success in life and the way it changes you marion davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger drama studio she becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world for a moment she even denies her poor past the cameos are simply hilarious certainly the scene where the main character marion davies seesmarion davies in the studios and concludes she doesnt seem that special its got to be one of the first movieinthemovies here and for real freaks its awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then a mustsee if you ask me
894,the last film in lucas saga is a lavish spectacularlooking production it is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy but i think it is a notch above episode iv and just a notch below episodes iii and v in fact i think it is the third best film in the 6part saga as far as im concerned it is still a grandiosely entertaining film it is not a movie with a beginning climax and ending the films mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind bring closure to lucas universe there is an air of finality attached to the whole thing which makes the film a little too sentimental but emotionally rewarding also it is a lot of fun new characters are introduced and old ones face new unexpected challenges c3po and r2d2 provide as usual great comic relief leia and solo are a wonderful romantic duo and luke is still a great character to identify with again it is lukes and vaders inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone lucas aggressive imagination is still very much apparent and the films themes of loyalty hope and redemption resonate strongly im glad lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode vii viii and ix because this film is a great bookend to a long fascinating and captivating saga not a perfect movie but fun in the best matinée style
895,for a danish movie i have to say that this is very good movieits in a class of its own yet it has an international potentialthe movie has a big budget and is starring famous danish actors and a few newcomers who play very well it can be watched by anyone who like adventures and a little bit of ghost moviedont be afraid be thrilled
896,return to cabin by the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original it had black humor good suspense nice looking girls and of course a psycho killer what are we missing i think nothing except we are left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television besides being one of the best sequels it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family recommended for everyone
897,absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time i have seen it at least a hundred times and i cant go through it without crying i defy anyone to watch the reunion of celie and nettie or shug and father and not feel your eyes getting misty whoopie goldberg should have one an award for amazing portrayal and for the person who said you cant love the movie if you loved the book wrong im a testament to that
898,sequels hardly ever live up to the original this definitely proves true in this case however if youre a big fan of the original than definitely give this a watch although the camera work is lacking brian krauses character is annoying and the plot is clique its much more funnier than the first and that is what i find entertaining about it dont see this movie expecting the same performance as in the first film quite frankly its a bit different rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplays stanley is off in hollywood trying to direct his dream project cabin by the lake this movie has a much different feel but its still great to see stanley back in actionim giving it a 6 out of 10
899,this is a great film  esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of todays politicallyminded filmmakers a film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days while the bouyant optimism of the 1960s cant be regained i think we can at least learn a lesson from the films breezy energy and charm i dont know what those who label the film boring were watching  theres so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that 15 min at a time
900,spoilers all too in real life as well as in the movies familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun or rifle in their hands the case of young and innocent in never handling or firing a gun jimmy davis franchot tone has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men like jimmy davis are forced to take up arms for their countryjimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the us army but was encouraged to stay by being belted in the mouth by his good friend fred p willis spencer tracy ended up on the front lines in france with jimmys unit pinned down by a german machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen german soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple it was when jimmy gunned down the last surviving german who raised his arms in surrender that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding himrecovering from his wounds at an army hospital jimmy fell in love with us army volunteer nurse rose duffy gladys george rose was really in love with jimmys good friend the happy go lucky fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her its when fred was lost during the fighting on the western front that rose thinking that he was killed fell in love and later married jimmy when fred unexpectedly showed up in the french town where jimmy now fully recovered from his wounds was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and rose who had already accepted jimmys proposal of marriage to herwith wwi over and jimmy marrying rose left fred whos still in love with her a bitter and resentful young man it was almost by accident that fred ran into jimmy on the streets of new york city and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and nonviolent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the european western front smug and sure of himself and his ability to shoot a gun jimmy had become a top mobster in new york citys underworld not only that but as fred later found out his wife rose had no idea what jimmy was really involved in with jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjusterjimmys life of crime came full circle when rose after she found out about his secret life ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a valentine day like massacre with his gang members dressed as cops of his rival mobsters while on trial jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then after his three year sentence is up get his life back together spoiler alert hearing rumors from fellow convicts that rose and his best friend fred were having an affair behind his back jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law its at freds circus where he works as both manger and barker that jimmy in seeing that rose as well as fred were true to him that he like at his trial had a sudden change of heart but the thought of going back to prison with at least another ten years added on to his sentence was just too much for jimmy it was then that jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job that he himself didnt have the heart to do for him
901,this show is a great history story its has everything from slaverythe way they were treated religion the ways jews were sent into hidingthe inquisition the belief in the orisha the african gods the way women were treatedincluding the daughters even down to homosexuality the way the characters are intertwined and that violante that character saddens me she is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around heri am so glad they decided to rerelease it to tv again although i would love to see the unedited version xica has become my heroine i look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it i love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century i look forward to my xica every night it would be great to dub it in english so the americans can love her too
902,i first saw enchanted april about five years ago i loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following christmas its about two women who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april leaving their humdrum lives behind them they are very sad women at the outset of the film and you cant help but root them on as they plan this getaway with two other women they invite along to share the expenses this is perhaps the most feel good movie i have ever seen it pure and simple with no car chases no animosities and no deaths it was made with care and in very good taste you cannot help but smile all through it  except when youre crying happy tears
903,if ever anyone queries whether cinema is an art form you can do worse than pointing them at this moviequite simply it is the perfect combination of story script actors and cinematography ever committed to celluloidthe story of a doomed bomber pilot who is missed by his heavenly conductor in the english fog during the second world war and his subsequent brushes with the celestial authorities or is it in his head is played with panache by david niven and kim hunter and is incredibly touching  especially in the opening scenes when the doomed pilot niven describes his plight to the ground radio operator hunterthe sense of otherworldliness is heightened by jack cardiffs photography and the incredible production designsthe supreme touches extend to the heaven shots appearing in black and white and earthbound scenes presented in technicolour  this is even mentioned by the celestial conductor a fantastic marius goringnot only a highpoint in british cinema but a highpoint in cinema period
904,i watched the mccoys reunion and was glad to see richard crenna and kathleen nolan and tony martinezto see them now was wonderful because i always watched the show growing up so when the tv said that there was going to be a reunion i was so excited  the only thing i could not figure out is why lydia reed hassie mccoy and michael winkelmanlittle luke was not on therei know that walter brennan had died so i got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to lydia reed hassie mccoy and michael winkelman little luke i would be thankful i have searched everywere and no luck the only thing i could find out about michael winkelman is he was supposed to be born in 1946 this show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learnedthe shows today dont have thatthe whole cast was incredable the only thing better than finding out obout them would be to meet them so since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do thank you glenda
905,this film is one of the few quality films of 2000 and definitely one of my best the scenario is based on the novel by vladimir nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant the photography of the film is excellent as is the acting of both turturro and watson turturro definitely gives his best performance to date proving hes worth much more than what we thought watson also performs brilliantlythe story is about a phenomenal chess player turturro which is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life the film is presented in a non linear time with multiple flashbacks of luzhins childhood through those the complex character of luzhin is described i have nothing more to say but to suggest this film to anyone
906,the plainsman represents the directorial prowess of cecil b demille at its most inaccurate and unfactual it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok gary cooper buffalo bill cody james ellison calamity jane jean arthur george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship the film is an attempt to buttress custers last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends truly this is the world according to demille  a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment but a pretty campy relic by todays standardstransfer considering the vintage of the film this is a moderately appealing transfer with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks theres a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments all in all the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract the audio is mono but nicely balancedextras forget it its universal bottom line as pseudohistory painted on celluloid this western is compelling and fun just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate
907,another entry in the holiday horror category that fills the shelves of your local video store the spoiler wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the cool kids who wronged him plot will of course be familiar to those whove watched it before and those whove seen it before will probably watch it again those who are expecting ingmar bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it marilyn manson on the soundtrack and david boreanaz denise richards and katherine heigl as eye candygo with the flow and enjoy it oh and i loved the creepy mask
908,too bad a couple of comments before me dont know the facts of this case it is based on actual events a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the wilmington dephiladelphia pa region from 96 through 2000 i have to admit i was highly skeptical of how hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and philadelphia inquirer news stories throughout the time period of course i immediately pointed out that the actress who i really like in cold case who played fahey looked nothing like her anne marie was actually prettier i have to admit though that mark harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as capanos and the behavior that capano exhibited throughout this period details of the case were right onno deviations of dramatic effecteven down to the carpet gun furniture and cooler in conclusion i also wanted to add that i have met tom carper many times at various functions a good man despite being a politician and i am so glad that he pulled the strings in the federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime guys like capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars
909,undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups it tells the story of patrick galloway an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in ireland to investigate some weird phainomena the game is set in ireland after world war one so dont expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchersall the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate onour hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the leftso you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game the graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power pclevel design is also cool and atmospheric mostly the game revolves around the covenant estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress thanks to the talent of clyve barker the game has an excelent storyline and plot something very rare for a first person shooter and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent but the game has two main flaws first of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of explorationsecondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high tech weaponry as far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not frustratingly difficult overall undying is a great game definitely one of the best fps out there
910,a hilarious neil simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end the late walter matthau is the grouchy excomedian who is persuaded to join together with his expartner the late oscarwinner george burns for a final reunion show on stagebenjamin martin is matthaus agent and nephew and the two have just as much chemistry as matthau and burns i love matthaus grumpy characterhes just the same as he always is and yet also very differentburns as the absentminded old man is just as funny as matthaumatthau want some crackers ive got coconut pineapple and grahamburns how about a plain crackermatthau i dont got plain i got coconut pineapple and grahamburns okaymatthau theyre in the cupboard in the kitchenburns maybe lateror how about thismatthau when i did black the whites knew what i was sayingyouve got to see it in the movie to understand itall in all a refreshingly hilarious sweet heartfelt warm belivable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time they just dont make them like this anymore in a time when all the newest comedies are crude juvenile and stupid this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really isfunny characters smart and funny dialogue and grand entertainmentone of the best buddy comedies of all time right up there with planes trains and automobiles lethal weapon and the hard wayyou may have a hard time finding this for rent or on tv but trust me it will be worth your time455 stars john ulmer
911,this is the start of a new and interesting star trek series it has a down to earthkind of feel with darker and less plaggy scenographythe characters need some more time to develop but they have potential one thing that is fairly disappointing with all star trek series really is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else earth has stopped war famine etc the female characters here are two subcommander tpol who is vulcan and communications officer hoshi who is human hoshi is quite wimpy and tpol is made to be a vulcan babe some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too american as opposed to the more international feel of the tngcrew but creates interesting dynamics a very good pilot though for a very good series
912,after some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie i was doubtful of giving it a go but i had 399 in my wallet  thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie  saw this and gave it ago  im glad i did i enjoyed it directed by the star of films such as chain reaction the ring bourne identitybrian cox i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it werent at all i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spiderman 2 the character doc ock he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw matthews name and that made me get it and no his part isnt big at all its very short at the very end of the film its not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film i suggest you give it a go some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing the acting and a bit more action but its watchable
913,this movie is not porn it was not meant to be porn and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered pornnow that that issue was sorted out i can say i thoroughly recommend this film as its issues are still widely available its funny the acting is great and it raises seriouscurious questionsi cant fully understand why this film was so mistreated probably this is why i plan to never visit the us lena is the true pioneer of the modern riotgrrrl movement confusion curiosity and wit are her main attributes she is occasionally angry but arent we all
914,the movie is great and i like the story i prefer this movie than other movie such the cell  sick movie  and highlander  silly movie  i just tell the truth i like a reality hehe and also a true story 
915,cinematically this film stinks so does a lot of the acting but idont care if there is a strong representation of what the 80s werelikefor a lot of us in the innercity anyways and what hiphop zulunation and break dancing were really likegreat music greatdancing it almost seems like a documentary of a time now pastwhen hiphop was a way of life its also interesting to see newyork looking like ground zero from a nuclear attack some viewersmay be too young to remember that it was a poor run down cityduring the 70s and 80s this is the best of all the hiphopbreakdancing movies that came out around that period of course the80s are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows andmovies but those of us who lived through it will always rememberit fondly for a time when music dancing and graffiti were fresh yo
916,deaf secretary carla emmanuelle devos is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagueswhen they suggest she needs an assistant it seems like the final insult but when the first applicant is excon paul vincent cassel she seizes the chance to change her lifecarla covers his mistakes and he anxious to go straight reluctantly helps her to take revenge on her colleagueswhen paul asks carla to return the favor she finds herself drawn into the criminal underworld ruled by ruthless lone shark marchand olivier gourmetrecognizing her ability to lipread as a weapon no one will have bargained for the two set out to see justice donefrench filmmaker jacques audiards third feature read my lips is a genredefying piece switching from dark social comedy to visceral fullthrottle thriller
917,david burtonrichard chamberlain quite goodis a lawyer more adept at handling corporate taxationand suffers from unusual dreams which bother him seeing this aboriginal man shrouded in darkness who is called on to take a case concerning a group of aboriginals charged with the murder of one of their own named billywe see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named charlienandjiwarra amagulauses a death bone to stop his heart meanwhile revolving around david bizarre weather patterns effect sydney such as rain beating down polluted dirt and rocksized hail during bright blue skieswith no sights of clouds such as the one that hits a school in central australia not to mention a deformed rainbow which is splitinto groups as david pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize one aboriginal named chrisdavid gulpililappears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and he finds that this man is one of those he is to represent at trial he finds that its quite possible after some strange meetings with charlie and conversations with chris that he very well might be linked to a spirit named mulkurul and that his dreams are actual premonitions of possible horrors yet to comeabsorbing apocalyptic drama builds its story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable with peter weir in charge the film is visually arresting as we see these very overwhelming images of possible doom towards civilization but the films most compelling angle is certainly davids journey to find that monumental truth that plagues him as he questions charlie and chris countlessly at first to help his men get off from a crime they didnt commit and ultimately to find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic that is occurring or might occur later
918,i really enjoyed this thriller i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over the cast was excellent the plot was suspenseful and entertaining and it was just an overall enjoyable movie i would rate this as one of the best thrillers ive ever seen the girls in it were really cute also especially denise richards she was very ornery throughout the movie and gave her character some oomph
919,i had the pleasure of seeing this film at the rhode island international film festival and was very impressed tess nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and i would love to see more of her films if she could do what she did with the budget of this film im very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture kudos to the cast for their terrific performances that little girl was gold and to whoever composed the music the warped row your boat blew me away very creative film all aroundi really hope to see it come out on video or dvd because id buy it in a second if you get the chance you should definitely see this film
920,as in amelie recent french films seem to be taking a stereotypical malefemale relationship slant centered on a female finding her one true love in this case desperation leads to a convict which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype clever and surprising story in many ways except that the female is there to support the malefor those of us that dont speak french the subtitles are a little quick but not unreasonablethe soundtrack as seems to be increasingly the case with european films is great and in perfect sync with the films variations nothing seems forced visually it reminds me of various urban horror movies theres a wes craven in chicago feel to it
921,i remember originally seeing this film at radio city music hall when it came out i didnt really understand the humor back then but this movie can make me laugh out loudwith all due respect to george burns rip walter matthau really deserved the oscar for this film his performance is amazinggiven the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character willie clark his mannerisms are firstrate you know what kind of songs he wrote sht and when speaking to the spanishspeaking guy at the front desk no no no enchilada absolutely hilariouskudos to richard benjamin who played straight man to matthaui just wish this was on dvd because my vhs recording is getting a bit oldi had no interest in seeing the remake with woody allen because in no way can it match the original

923,im italian and when ive recently looked again this film i astonished for its beauty the first time i was 10 years old and i liked it but today i can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings now i can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the italian cinema pasolini etc by that time gone the hollywood epic films are goodfor fun perhaps this odyssey had no english version because is not enough funny not suitable for popcorn and coke audience however suitable for homer pathos and existentialist reflectionsin italy was recently released a very good dvd version integral with excellent colors you can find it in some file sharing but its italian only and without subtitles too bad also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable
924,anthony manns westerns with jimmy stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with john ford and howard hawks as the best film director in that genre he certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy stewart  in manns films there is an edge to jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience in winchester 73 it was the relationship of stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance here it is a i trust only myself attitude which leads to one complication after another even before the film properly begins he as jeff webster kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to seattle because of some dispute we never are clear about it  either they wanted to leave the cattle drive or they tried to steal the cattle he meets his match in skagway the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to dawson skagways boss is a socalled law man named gannon john mcintyre who reminds one of the real boss of skagway in the gold rush jefferson soapy smith and judge roy bean the problem is that neither smith nor bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money stewarts herd interrupted a public hanging  so as a penalty fine the herd is confiscated to be sold later for gannons profit stewart is partner with ben walter brennan  who oddly enough won his last oscar playing judge roy bean they are also joined by rube morris jay c flippen and also meet two women the sophisticated rhonda castle ruth roman and the friendly and helpful renee vallon corinne calvert rhonda works closely with gannon but had helped jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in seattle however she has a similar i only trust myself attitude to jeff she does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to dawson he ben and rube go but at night while the others are asleep they go back and steal back their cattle renee follows and warns them that gannon and his associates are following jeff holds off gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the canadian border although gannon points out that since jeff has to return by way of skagway gannon can wait until he does to hang himthe reunited party of rhonda and jeff split over the trail to take to dawson jeff opting for a longer and safer route after he is proved right they go by his route and reach dawson only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields the herd is sold to rhonda and jeff ben rube and renee start prospecting there is soon two groups in the town of dawson one led by connie gilchrist and chubby johnson want to build a decent town but the mounties wont be setting up a station in dawson for months the other centering around the dancehall run by rhonda are in cahoots with gannon who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of gunslingers robert j wilke  really scary in one sequence with chubby johnson and jay c flippen jack elam and harry morgan jeff wishes to steer clear of both and head with his new wealth and ben for a ranch they want in utah but will they get there and will jeff remain neutralthe performances are dandy here including stewart as a man who is willing to face all comers but would otherwise be peaceful enough brennan is playing one of his patented old codgers whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results flippen is a drunk at first but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind  and one who has a chance to verbally stab stewart in the heart using stewarts own words against him mcintyre would achieve stardom on television in wagon train replacing ward bond but his work in manns films show his abilities as a villain such as his trade post opportunist who outsmarts himself in winchester 73 he is as is said elsewhere on this thread really sleazy  but he has a sense of humor roman is an interesting blend of opportunist and human being whose fate is determined by her better feelings and calvert is both a voice of conscience and a frontier gigi aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding womanbest of all is the canadian rockies background  as wonderful in its way as the use of monument valley by john ford mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film and the viewer will appreciate the results
925,of the elements that make this the best at this point i have to say 1 is christine mcintire shemps scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent i imagine that as one poster suggested christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil to be smiling at shemps possibly dyinganother character who helps this stand out is the goon his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goofball hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or for that matter anywhere i would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this but hey when a short is this good whos going to complain not i
926,two thirds of nearly 2000 imdb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes was this a record or merely a faulty vcr although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination but for some reason i imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it my mind was changed by elizbeth von arnims original book my wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things but i gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing although in no way syrupy and was also very well written i realised my wife would enjoy watching the film and so decided to buy her the videotape i am now very glad that i did and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful premussolini italian atmosphere the story is set in the immediate post ww1 period and starts with two married london ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together away from their families in a rented villa in italy force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses not only between these four very disparate mature ladies but also with the occasional male visitor if you want action thrills dramatic sex scenes natural or manmade disasters or harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you but imdb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch and if you care to give it a try you may as i did come to rank it among your much loved filmsit is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which i am already familiar in many cases i find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that i actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book effectively unrolled before my eyes perhaps italy itself has some part in this the last time i had this experience was when i was watching tales from boccaccios decameron on tv generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events this works very well although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story great credit is due to the director mike newell and all members of the cast particularly those well known british actresses who play the four principal ladies
927,first an explanation despite my headline im giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is not one of the best films ever made all the criticisms registered here have valid points also be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate neil simons brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter he does have a distinctively new york ear for dialogue  especially dry jewish lovesuffused sarcasm  and if you have trouble accepting sarcasm as an expression of love then you might have trouble accepting the optimism at the heart of this movieso much for warnings heres my main point walter matthau is flatout perfect even beyond perfect in this movie i have never seen him funnier or more touching for that matter  because at the same time that he shows us the hilariousness of this character who refuses to give up his big star selfimage or insufferable attitudes even as his coherence is in decline he also shows us the more vulnerable maybe even heartbreakingly scared person inside the grouch and he only barely shows us that sad part  its just enough to really get to you if you happen to be coping with your own fathers or husbands mental decline right now i mention this as a warning but artistically its just enough pathos to give this character the most authentically deep roots im seen in possibly any film performance this is beyond method acting  matthaus performance is exquisite as character work and a pure delight as comic delivery this is a masterpiece of comic actingabout richard benjamin i personally find his acting annoying in general and his work in this movie is no exception  although he has some fine moments here chicken is funny is one of them so if you like him you should like him here and if you dont this movie wont change your mindabout the 1976 oscarsi agree that matthau was unfortunate to be up against nicholson in cuckoos nest that year it was a killer year for leadingactor competition if only there were separate oscars for comedy and drama then i think the best actor oscars would have gone to al pacino for dog day afternoon and to walter matthau for the sunshine boys  not to dis jacks fine work as mcmurphy but i think that pacino and matthau were each clearly more masterful and astoundingly effective and downright legendary in their performances than nicholson was that year also i believe that burns got the supporting actor oscar more for sentimental reasons than for the quality of his performance  i mean he was good in this movie but not that good burnss fineasever but unexceptionalinitself return to show biz beat brad dourifs truly brilliant debut in cuckoos nest not to mention chris sarandons stunning debut in dog day afternoon  which i think proves my theory oscar theories aside heres my bottom line review if you like matthaus comic acting then see this movie and savor his powerhouse tirades and wonderful grandmotherinspired gestures fleeting facial expressions and seemingly unscripted asides but if youre currently dealing with the pain of watching an old person lose his grip then be warned that this movie might either be the comic relief you need or a dose of reality too painful to watch right now
928,i have previously seen zu warriors from the magic mountain in that film the setting takes place in chinas mountains the legend of zu looks like another dimension thank that to tsui harks extensive use of cgi effects hes able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds a land where beings fly freely and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades split swords and the ultra cool moon orbwhile there are many characters in this one the focus is mainly on king sky and enigma the romance aspect is there although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor cecilia cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching in the beginning i like how she resembles the countess from zu warriors and she does well playing enigma as she deals with facing her past life oh by the way did i mention that cecilias very appealing to the eyein truth zu warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 tsui hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema
929,ok so this is coming a few weeks late but it is here mostly this is because of statements of various negative natures starting with the technology when star trek tos ran special effect technology was extreamely low tec and more than that the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups in the 35 years seince tos premiered the crew of star trek have become experts at economyultimately they have decided quite rightly in my mind to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all so what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from star trek ii as for the nits being picked about first contact with the klingon empire it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and riker that earth only met the klingons in 2200 nothing was firmly establishedenterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that weve seen in a while this is what voyager could have been no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies but be thankful that star trek has so few so quit gripping and enjoy
930,while i dont agree with bobs and tammys decision to give up baby jesse and its something id never do they were trying to do what was best for the baby the way this movie is written you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe from all different aspects patty duke antagonist almost unheard of as far as im concerned but during the movie she really convinces you that shes psychotic or at least that theres something seriously wrong with her her character is the meaning of emotionally disturbed the movie seems to end quickly leaving things somewhat unresolved but other than that this movie is really great it really makes you think its not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute thatll make you laugh but it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs see things from others perspectives and discover a little something about yourself caution you may even grow while watching this movie and its all worth it in the end
931,ive seen hundreds of silent movies some will always be classics such as nosferatu metropolis the general and wings but among them my favorite is this film it may not be the bestbut a favorite yes in fact when i looked it up on imdb i noticed i immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so goshdarn cute and wellmade marion davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not just william randolph hearsts mistressthe story involves a hick from georgia coming to hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a mustsee
932,i settled back to watch read my lips a plate of freedom fries before me the food was quickly forgotten as i became engrossed by director and cowriter jacques audiards original and superb thrillercarla emmanuelle devos is a secretary at a firm that develops major building projects she actually has some significant responsibilities that dont often fall to secretaries and shes capable and ambitious and thwarted by a male hierarchy that will exploit but not reward herwork piling up faster than she can handle it carla is told to hire a secretary enter excon and general layabout paul vincent cassel he lies about his skills and in fact has none that any legitimate enterprise might require after an initial serious misunderstanding by paul as to carlas interest in him the two become allies a quirky friendship starts in a stunt that would have made a real carla a major contender on the apprentice she trumps her egotistic male adversary at work with pauls connivance exit the rivalcarla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid with it she hears almost normally she turns the hearing aid off to isolate herself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people shes also very lonely a heroic makeup effort was made to have her appear plain but shes truly beautiful she hasnt a boyfriend she babysits so a friend can have a liaison it is a french movie worse and humiliatingly she accedes to a girlfriends plea that she hang out somewhere while that married friend has it off with her paramour in carlas bed not niceas carla and paul get to know each other better the barely repressed larcenous side of the not so former felon emerges theres a side story by the way of pauls relationship with his parole officer which neatly complements the main plot and has its own big surprise endingread my lips ingenious paul recognizes that carlas ability to read lips even from a considerable distance is more than the amusing parlor trick it first seems to befrom there a caper develops enough saidpaul and carla are a true criminal oddball couple she wants love but will also accept money he wants her sort of but business must come before possible erotic satiation together cassel and devos are strong actors carrying an unusual crime tale to its end very convincinglyrent it or buy it but if you enjoy a good crime story youll go for read my lips and you may well want to watch it several times i do910
933,what a surprise two outstanding performances by the lead actresses in this film this is the best work busy phillips has ever done and the best from erika christensen since traffic this film certainly should be in oscar contention see this movie
934,the delivery of some very humorous rude lines by pierce brosnan is alone worth the price of admission he plays a kind of james bonds psycho twin brother separated at birth no doubt as an intense hitman his character is very sexual but even better very funny add the kindhearted uberlikable american guy next door greg kinnear to set up contrast the myriad locations vivid colors and quickwitted humor provide great entertainment hope davis is well cast as the gem of a wife but the focus of the film is on the two fellows a new odd couple and thats the part that works very well have a great probably rrated laugh and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper
935,the only reason im giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played tadashis tormentors were not up to the job i presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy but they were not well coached and their scenes were a minor annoyance i say not to judge this by us standards because its full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that japanese culture readily embraces and is not beholden to the blackhat whitehat moral constraints us kids films are routinely subjected to for example there is a preciously funny moment when tadashis small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai and shojothe avuncular kirin heralddoes what many a stressedout japanese adult would do hint this would not happen in a disney film this picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids movie early on theres a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book there was a tv commercial in japan a couple years before this movie came out it was a stopmotion clay animation about a kid whos depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room his mother yells at him from downstairs to shut up then someone gives him a candy bar and he cheers up and sings a happy tune but his mother comes in and tells him to shut up again and gives him a dope slap that leaves a dent in his forehead i mention this commercial because it was considered funny and i didnt hear any objections to it while i was there there is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in the great yokai war than one would find in a disney movie as a parent if this were a us film i would be up in arms about such things although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture which of course are also not black and white since its a japanese movie i accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a us production however id probably be a little uneasy taking young kids to see it without giving them some sort of preshow briefing andor postshow debriefing about the violence and other off color stuff or id wait till theyre older to show it to them
936,i had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical genre hollywood film story lines fail and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste but then i saw zentropa europa and my faith was renewed not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating the narrator max von sydow takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into europa 1945 we have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slowmoving moment that leads you to death unlike many films it doesnt cut after one second of showing for example a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a mans final moments i think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means i would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email enjoy it
937,i think the weighted average for this film is too low i give it a 7 very entertaining although over the top in a few places my wife says it passes the danielle steele test superb performances throughout particularly by andie macdowell
938,a few years ago a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the michael mann film heat on it after we finished that movie and were about to stand up we saw that there is another film just after tough on the cassettes envelope the owner didnt write it up yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening which lacked creditssome two hours later i just sat there wondering how could i not have heard of this masterpiece beforethis film was europa lars von trier woke film noir from the dead deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets yet often there was haunting similarity with postwar german photographs i saw and then the tricky cutsthe story itself is a hardtotake moral odyssey that has no happy end a young american pacifist of german descent comes to postwar germany intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his countrymen dropped but he mostly meets distrust and selfdestructive defiance he hires with zentropa a diningandsleepingcar company modeled on mitropa whose owner is one of the nazi collaborators the occupiers whitewash our hero falls in love with his daughter  who later turns out to be a member of the werewolf nazi postwar terrorists when he doesnt understand the world or just europeans anymore in his rage he blows up a railroad bridge under a train which he just savedas a final note for historical correctness in the real world the werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies they were mostly a final nazi propaganda coup after an ss unit assassinated the major of alliedoccupied aachen two months before the capitulation the nazis announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines the werewolf but only a few hundred of mostly hitler youth received some training and while two or three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists or forcedlabourer foreigners in bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants with hitlers death and the wars end it all fell aparthowever the werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers they feared the werewolf everywhere suspected it behind any serious accident  but without exception another cause was found later ignored by some recent pseudohistorians for example when a gas main exploded in the police hq of bombedout bremen or when the soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in berlin the effect was strongest on the soviets who arrested tens of thousands in large part children preemptively on suspicion of being werewolf and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died
939,this film has a rotting core of flexible morality and yet a quirky sense of justice so many of the regular joes among us would love to stick it to the man the man in this case is represented by several different characters mr keller who carla reports to at her office later paul owes 70 large to mr marchand the club owner and then there is pauls parole officer there seems to be so much question about this last characters side story reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of pingpong between our two protagonists escalating titfortat until their lives change dramatically they are beholden to each agent of the man one or both could be fired killed or imprisoned if they dont do as they are toldthe film has a sense of relief at the end carla finally gets laid her boss is forced out for being a jerk mr club owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom they get the money and they need not worry about reporting in to the parole officer because his moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement or whatever the police found to arrest him it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight never mind that someone else may get pauls file later to supervise his release for the moment they are free they might even get away with it woohoothey stuck it to the man
940,in one of neil simons best plays creaky cranky exvaudeville stars played by walter matthau and george burns are teaming up for a tv comedy special the problem is they havent even seen each other in over a decade full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes this story flies along with a steady stream of humor good work also by richard benjamin as the harried nephew rosetta lenoire as the nurse and howard hesseman as the tv commercial director steve allen and phyllis diller appear as themselves trivia note the opening montage contains footage from hollywood revue of 1929 and shows marie dressler bessie love polly moran cliff edwards charles king gus edwards and the singing brox sisters
941,if you like adult comedy cartoons like south park then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at bromwell high keisha natella and latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches i think keisha is a good leader there are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school theres the idiotic principal mr bip the nervous maths teacher and many others the cast is also fantastic lenny henrys gina yashere eastenders chrissie watts tracyann oberman smack the ponys doon mackichan dead ringers mark perry and blunders nina conti i didnt know this came from canada but it is very good very good
942,the one and only season has just aired here in australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant i love it all the story lines are so good and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other their problems were real and it really drew you into the show the show is basically about this family called the days and their lives the family consisted of abby day mum jack day dad natalie day sporty daughter cooper day outsider son and nathan day boy genius son each episodes a day of their life with coopers perspective on things throughout it i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great he was by far my favorite character it ended with so many things it couldve continued with im really sad another season wasnt made it was a great show im gonna miss it
943,thanks to kevin smith a bunch of geeks are running around saying that return of the jedi isnt any good because its actually fun to watch and oh no muppets are involved that makes it bad everyone liked return of the jedi until someone in a kevin smith movie made a negative comment about it now all of a sudden people people look at you like you have some kind of disease if you mention how much you like it this movie is so much better than anything kevin smith ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it this movie is good fun its just as awesome as i remember it being when i was six enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing kevin smiths opinions his arent correctand that ewok song at the end ruled i bet you people dont even enjoy ewoks battle for endor im going to set you all on fire
944,i simply love this movie i also love the ramones so i am sorta biased to begin with in the first place there isnt a lot of critical praise to give this film either you like it or you dont i think its a great cult movie
945,at first this looked like a boring comedy like the odd couple but when i got into it it turned out to be a really funny film basically forgetful excomedians willy clark golden globe winner and oscar and bafta nominated walter matthau and al lewis oscar winning and golden glove nominated george burns were a great comedy duo and a brought back together to revive their hospital sketch for a tv show willys nephew ben clark golden globe winning richard benjamin is confident they can get together again with no hard feelings for each other how wrong he is they cannot get on all the time they are both forgetful especially during conversation but they do it eventually also starring lee meredith as nurse in sketch miss mcintosh carol deluise as mrs doris green als daughter rosetta lenoire as odessa willys nurse and muppets from spaces f murray abraham as mechanic i think the best line of the film is burns mentioning that matthau called him a son of a bitch bastard it was nominated the oscars for best art directionset decoration and best writing screenplay adapted from other material it was nominated the bafta for best screenplay and it won the golden globe best motion picture  musicalcomedy and it was nominated for best screenplay very good
946,i thought that this film was very well made heath leger was very convincing and his irish accent was flawless orlando bloom and naomi watts were also really good and believable how true it is to what really happened i have no idea but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over 30000 signed a petition for ned kelly not to be hanged so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat baffled why it didnt do better in the cinemas
947,if anyone is interested in obtaining a copy of this film please read the bottom of this description first telecast by cbs on november 30 2003 the madefortv finding john christmas is a sequel to the previous years a town without christmas with peter falk reprising his role as versatile guardian angel max valerie bertinelli plays kathleen mcallister a divorced smalltown nurse whose depression over the fact that the hospital er she maintains may be forced to shut down because of a 100000 debt is briefly lifted when she spots a newspaper picture taken by photojournalist noah greeley david cubitt the picture shows an act of bravery performed by noahs firefighter brother hank william russ who mysteriously left town 25 years ago and hasnt been seen since hank would like to quietly slip back into town without explanation or fanfare but this proves impossible when noahs newspaper posts a 50000 reward to identify hank known only to the public as john christmas and theres something very very curious about that photo it also shows a santa claus suit seemingly floating in midair without an occupant that elusive santa is of course the angelic max who pops up now and again throughout the story in a variety of guises to solve problems dispense advice tie up loose plot strandsand even share a musical duet with kathleens talented daughter socorro jennifer pisanainterested in having a copy write to me here iamaseal2yahoocom
948,return of the jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series and is a fine conclusion to the star wars saga with han solo imprisoned by jabba the hut and the empire building a new death star the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side and only our favourite heroes can pull it offthe opening sequence set on tatooine we see jabbas palace a pit of slavery and scum and new home to han solo as luke and the gang prepare for his rescue and with lukes jedi powers they have the edgewe also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end han leia and chewy battle it out on endor desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the death star the rebel fleet led by lando battle with the imperial fleet while they wait for the shields to go down and luke has a final showdown with darth vader an epic end to a classic saga and its only just of the pace of the first two1010
949,now admittedly im no ardent student of the genre as a matter of fact ive tended always to shy away from westerns because in spite of all their critical cachet as americas primal stories or whatever they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either shoot up the injuns the big gunfight or hey lets form a posse in other words it always seemed to me a genre so rooted in and tied to convention that it left precious little room for surprise or originality and yes i have seen at least some of the socalled greats and unapologetically lump them into this negative assessment  including stagecoach rio bravo my darling clementine and of course the infamous but profoundly dull clint eastwoodsergio leone teamups in the 60sbut when i saw this movie on tv  as part of a commemorative jimmy stewart weekend upon his death  i finally got it i understood at least in theory what the western mythos has to offer as a serious thematic preoccupation aside from just action and thrills it is the pushpull between lawlessness and order the american west represented freedom but also the prospect of the wild the untamed respectable folk could get hurt out there which of course meant that perhaps  just perhaps  it wasnt meant for respectable folk and that the only residents should be the amoral and the shifty those who dispensed justice strictly from the barrel of their revolvers and where kill or be killed would ever be the law of the land in such an environment of course the true heroes are the ones who are ornery and freespirited enough to be out there in the first place and so reject society at least as it manifested itself on the eastern seaboard and yet have enough sense of justice to believe that a society based on chaos and fear just is not right catching and examining that disparity between law and disorder in the main character himself is i believe after seeing this movie the highest and truest goal of any western sadly it is so often not the case as the white hats are completely white the black ones completely black and lets not even get started talking about the indians ok and there is precious little shades of gray in betweennot in this one jimmy stewart plays a blatant fortune hunter who follows the trail of miners before him into the alaskan wilderness to prospect for gold he is joined in this by his lifelong buddy played by walter brennan perhaps the western cliché character to end them all  but nevertheless enjoyable here as always  and no one else pointedly they are out for themselves and while stewart displays his patented charm come on we could never really dislike the guy now could we we are left with little doubt that his is basically a selfcentered selfinterested character none of his gosh or oh golly gee humanism is allowed to come through or rather it has to be earned by the end of the picture in the way i described above he must confront the lawlessness in himself and weigh it against the need for order and justice which are so blatantly lacking in the border town which serves as the miners starting point on their gold dust trail this town is ruled tightly by its wicked sheriff mr gannon played by john mcintire in one of the best bad guy performances ive ever seen he comes on with so much charm and humor and has such a relaxed and interesting rapport with stewart that it actually takes awhile to recognize that he is the bad guy  so that when it finally sinks in it does so with double force further by establishing a type of breezy if necessarily guarded camaraderie between mcintire and stewart the film plays up the notion of how close in temperament they really are  and so how far a moral distance stewart must walk by the end of the filmi wont go through all the twists and turns the plot takes  see those for yourself as well as the rugged and gorgeous alaskan scenery  filmed on location mind you not cheap painted stills that the studio made up whats key here is how much this story focuses upon character with great dialogue and character interaction substituting for gunplay much of the time  although the film has just enough action and adventure to prevent it from ever being static read talky definitely one of the greatest performances ive seen from stewart showing he could play the renegade the mans man just as convincingly as the decent and upright guy next door if anything in fact his everyman qualities lend greater strength to his characterization making him seem less mythic or overblown  like say eastwood or john wayne  and more a threedimensional personage his relationship with brennan is wellplayed understated but nevertheless touching with a faint suggestion of george and lenny from of mice and men  an altogether different type of westerni certainly have more westerns to see but this is for now my favorite and the yardstick by which i will necessarily judge all the others it deserves to be much better known and appreciated than it is
950,exquisite comedy starring marian davies with the affable william haines young peggy arrives in hollywood seeking stardom cameo performances showcase all the stars in mgms heaven in the famous commissary scene plus lots of vintage film making detail for the scholar pic also captures for posterity davies famous wickedly sarcastic impersonations of the top stars of the day her swanson is a beautpeggy even catches herself as she encounters the famous star marian davies at tennis turns up her nose and comments ohh i dont like hermy print was perfect story direction acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados
951,it was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series from one to seven and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain plus it showed some of the puppet master series that i didnt see and i what to see it so badly like part two it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans which is cool and showed the return of the puppet master from part one it also showed little aliens from part 4 that was also cool it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it didso thanks to this puppet master is going to be a big hit
952,yokai monsters spook warfare yokai daisenso 2005 a movie about yokai or traditional japanese monsters of folklore it is alternatively known as big monster war or as ghosts on paradethe yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak kappa water imp a living brella a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic a woman with a second face on the back of her head a dwarf priest with an enormous gourdlike wrist  so onthese sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore but from a type of summer entertainment of the tokugawa era comparable to todays halloween haunted houses or the freak shows of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks ghosts  goldfish monsters  dancing oneheaded umbrellas were trumped up to create chills during the hot summers the fatcheek woman  such were recreated by tricks or illusions based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls  if their design for the movie is a bit simple  hoky this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chillsthese rather endearing monsters have to face off  destroy an ancient babylonian vampire demon who has come to japan  disguised himself as a samurai lord despite that some of the japanese apparitions are a bit goofy  too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak it is all played very pokerfaced  is very charming it has some beautiful cinematography much as would be provided in a cgi film of the same decade viewed in the right mood or with the right friends it is exciting moving  touchingyoshiyuki kuroda also directed the famed lone wolf  cub white heaven  hell 1974 and was the special fx director for the excellent daimajin trilogy the yokai monsters series is not the equal of majin at its best but the yokai are nevertheless great fun the first miike movie which is the most childoriented of his family films with the gozu  izoo consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers
953,sublimity is the way we have to reach for the beauty and sublimity is the stuff this film is made of if not his best its my most loved of all bogdanovich moviesthis unique masterpiece remind us as most of the other films from the director what life is or should be about love lost or failure and hope and faith and charity as the song from whom the films takes its title gershwins well known composition the film makes the impossible true and tries to make us aware that noone is able to judge anybody all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction the first ten minutes with the detectives following the ladies almost without a line of dialogue constructed upon the looks and views of the characters with that bogdanovich touch based on the pointofview is a class on cinema language something that pb learned well from his admired directors from the golden age of the movies with a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack including the best of sinatras trilogy this movie full of selfconsciousness and compassion and far away from selfindulgence and emptiness as some critics wrote deserves a better place on the history of american cinema than where it have been placed its not long on style short on substance it is complex in its simplicity and beautiful absolutely beautiful
954,i love tudor chirila and maybe thats why i enjoyed the movie so much two days before the movie premiere i went to see his concert i saw the trailer and the video zmeu before the movie and i thought i had it all figured i was wrong instead of a good movie i assisted a great one i felt the movie it was sad it was funny but most of all it pictured love i cant even begin to describe the soundtrack so i wont  im not a movie critic i cant describe it in more words my kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless thank god for the keyboard  thank you tudor giurgiu thank you maria popistasu thank you ioana barbu and thank you tudor chirila encore 
955,critics need to review what they class as a quality movie i think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the matrix style of films europa is a breath of fresh air a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film lars von trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension the back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters and the focus of the conversation they are having other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene the commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actionsi could talk about the effects more but i think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own and really heighten the drama of the film a film to buy if you dont own already and one to see if you have not1010 dont miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors
956,this movie is awesome sort of it dosent really say much or do much but it is an awesome movie to watch because of how stupid it is the high school is taken over by evil mstogar that hates the one thing that all the students love rock roll riff randle get everyone tickets for the ramones show and this movie peaks with a take over of the school led my riff randle  the ramones this movie has everything a bad script questionable directing bad actorsie clint howard  pj soles an awesome soundtrackextreme campyness these elements  much more come together to make this what it isa classicnote  during the live ramones set notice that darby crash of the germs is in the front of the crowd neato

961,foxes is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too fast in the 1980s and unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it porkys fast times at ridgement high the movie holds up well against timeits theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and jodie foster and sk8er boi scott baio remember him lead a fine young cast thats well worth watchingthe film follows four southern california girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents the teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties concerts or out on the street seldom are they home because instant gratification is a pill party or boy awaybut rather than condemning them the film is sympathetic blaming absent uncaring adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone and the charismatic cast is impossible to dislikethe films opening  a long and loving pan  sets the tone for what follows we see the girls asleep at daybreak amid the objects that define teen girlhood from twinkies to a picture of a young john travola while donna summers on the radio is scored beneathfrom there the movie picks up speed as the girls head off to school and to life annie runaway rocker cherie currie is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill deirdre kandice stroh is the boy crazy drama queen madge marlilyn stroh is the shy girl in over her head and foster is the one with the plan its her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line sally kellermanits an almost impossible job and one that foster ultimately fails atdespite its age foxes remains a pleasure to watch dated hair clothes and references to olympic skater dorothy hamill havent hurt the moviethe cinematography is simply stunning with breathtaking filtered shots of the la basin at dawn dusk and at night giorgio moroder adds a 80s soundtrack featuring the likes of donna summer and janis ianperhaps the movies biggest disappointment is that the young stars around foster never broke out like the casts of st elmos fire 1985 or empire records 1995 foxes shows why they should have but perhaps like bowling for soups song 1985 they just hit a wall
962,ive read one comment which labeled this film trash and a wasteof time i think this person got their political undies tugged a bittoo muchi just rented the new criterion dvds of both yellow and bluethese filmsalthough hardly greathave at least become ofhistorical interest as to the socalled radical studentpoliticalsocial movementof the late 60si hadnt seen either picture and from their notorious reputation iwas expecting some real porn there isnt any there is frontalnudity including the still verboten frontal male nudity automaticnc17the orwellianx in the us but i wasnt expecting the filmsinyourface democratic socialist message though it tends to the simplistic  i thought it occassionally madeits points well both films occassionally had me laughing out loudand the directors commentary made it clear there was plenty ofparody in the film especially the supposedly pornographic sexscenes the first such scene is very realistic the lead couple isclumsy inept funny and endearing in their first copulation scenethe secondwhich caused the most complaintshas fakedcunnilingus and fellatio and the last is the end of an angry fightthat is believablethe extras include an informative introduction to the film aninterview with the original american distributor and his attorneyexcerpts from trial testimony in the us and a diary commentaryby the director on some scenesthis is the film that blue noses wouldnt let alone and led to thepivotal prurient interest with no social redeeming value standardthat thankfully still standsthose with an interest in the quirks of history will find this a mustsee
963,having been a fan of columbo i was sorely disappointed in corky romano while certainly a funny movie falks mob boss character was a far cry from the lovable lieutenant hes played for so many years especially with the offensive language he used after corky romano i was honestly both surprised by and soured on mr peter falk however having just seen finding john christmas and its predecessor a town without christmas for the first time within a week of each other i have to say that max peters falks delightful character in both movies is surely as memorable and lovable as columbo while parts of the movie are quite predictable such scenes in no way take away from the enjoyment of seeing the story played out i too wish i had recorded both of these heartwarming christmas movies and i highly recommend them whether youre a falk fan a christmas nut or simply someone who enjoys the occasional feelgood movie of the week this movie may end up lost among the throngs of madefortv holiday flicks so be sure to find finding john christmas before its too late

965,this is one of the most amazing stories i have ever seen if this film had been directed by larry clark then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first placeinstead the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting and how it effected the victims who survivedi had seen busy phillips in other films before but her performance in this movie is by far her best the only other movie that ive seen with erika christensen is swim fan which made me almost not want to watch this film but she turned in a very good performance herselfthis is one of the few movies i have seen that was actually able to make me cry trust me when i tell you that doesnt happen very oftenhome room is a beautiful film and thats all there is too it

967,vincent cassel plays the part of paul an excon assigned to an office job where he meets carla a secretary who is quite deaf when she has her hearing aids in very deaf when not played by emmanuelle devos together they help each other to develop as peoplewhat was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters  not fitting into obvious stereotypes paul appears uneasy in the office environment is it that hes just not cut out for work this belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shinesthe film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally even if we think it is harmless or justifiedfinally it is a film full of great moments both touching and humorous one is when carla is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby she continues to cuddle it  but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort
968,lars von triers europa is a worthy echo of the third man about an american coming to postworld war ii europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mysteryjeanmarc barr plays leopold kessler a germanamerican who refused to join the us army during the war arrives in frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the zentropa railway what he doesnt know is the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group called the werewolves who target american allies leopold is strongly against taking any sides but is drawn in and seduced by katharina hartmann barbara sukowa the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company her father was a nazi sympathizer but is pardoned by the american colonel harris eddie considine because he can help get the german transportation system up and running again the colonel soon enlists or forces leopold to be a spy without giving him a choice or chance to think about it to see if the werewolves might carry out attacks on the trainssoon leopold is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noirish way where everyone and everything is not what it seems its amazing to watch the naive leopold deal with everything his lover the terrorists the colonel annoying passengers his disgruntled uncle even the railway companys officials who come to examine his work ethic before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control the film is endlessly unpredictablethe film stylishly shot it always takes place at night during the winter with lots of falling snow its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout also background screens displaying images that counter act with the images up front add max von sydows hypnotic narration and europa becomes a dreamlike place thats out of this worldthis is now a personal favorite film of mine
969,far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30s and 50s george c scott was born to be scrooge just as he was born to be patton mr scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century the character of scrooge as played by mr scott seemed to jump off the screen scott as scrooge brought an richer more robust yet a more deeply moving scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century london mr scott seemed to bring scrooge to a more personal understandable yet highly conflicted level his role was acted with the great authority scott always bring to the screen yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper almost as a soliloquy as he would berate the christmas holiday in one breath yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line he could portray the sour and crusty scrooge and a misunderstood sympathetic scrooge all in the same scenetruly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation
970,to those who have not followed the anne marie fahey murder case you are missing out one of the saddest yet complicated murder of all the murderer is popular delaware attorney tom capano and the victim is the delaware governors scheduling secretary anne marie fahey their relationship was a wellkept secret until her disappearance and murder she wanted to leave him but he just wouldnt let her go so easily on the other hand he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters where did he find the time to have two mistresses and a domestic family life besides the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four hour mini series while the actress who plays ms fahey does a fine job she does not have her dark long hair his other mistress is definitely more attractive than the actual woman mark harmon is better looking and does an emmy award winning performance as tom capano it would be better with actual delaware and philadelphia locations with ann rules executive producing she adds accuracy to anne maries characteristic of organization and her personal battle with an eating disorder these bits of information might be overlooked by any other executive producer or director if you have not read the book it is well worth it ann rule is a fascinating storyteller of true crime it is ironic that mark harmon plays tom capano he also played ann rules former friend and subject ted bundy in an another book adaptation many years ago he was brilliant then and now he does an above average job with an amazing story even president clinton offered his assistance in the anne marie fahey case and now the former governor tom carper is now the united states senator for delaware who defeated longtime popular incumbent senator richard roth in the november 2000 election if you dont think the movie is interesting then the read rules book
971,billed as takashi miikes first family film  by people who havent seen zebraman presumably yokai daisenso takes things even further in the direction of familyfriendliness diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale a young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware the film is evidently bigger budget than anything else miike has done with lots of cgi to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures the yokai perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors but i think its probably just that he wanted to do something different hes really never been a onetrick pony but often gets accused of it  perhaps yokai is designed to silence those critics regardless its a great project for miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention intotheres a very cartoonish feel to the production evoking thoughts of miyazaki in places the yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on japanese folk tales which certainly influenced miyazaki as well particularly spirited away it must remembered that miike has nothing like the budget of a harry potter film to work with so the special effects arent going to be seamless hollywood style work  some bluescreening is especially obvious some of the special effects are great though with some very well animated creatures a mix of cg stopmotion and puppetry i think the little sockpuppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was meant to look really cheap and is all the cuter for it  the young lad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job  its so hard to find a preteen who actually understands the concept of acting but 9 year old ryunosuke kamiki is a genuine talent i see he did voices in the last 2 miyazaki films chiaki kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece though mai takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixieeared river princess  yum yum those looking for another violent perverted gangster film arent going to find what theyre looking for in yokai but if youre a fan of miike because of his imagination and wit theres plenty to satisfy here and it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company youve got 
972,i didnt have many expectation going into the film but i thought it was fantastic pierce brosnan is outstanding in a very different role he has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor pierce and greg kinnear play off each other great and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time the humor is dark the performances by brosnan kinnear and hope davis are great mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship and you have a great film this is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time this is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the postbond era of brosnans career
973,in arlington heights il we never had a cafeteria in any of the elementary schools 1961 so i rode my bike home from school for lunch and always watched this game true i was 11 but i thought it was the greatest thing on id draw hidden pictures on my blackboard and see if my family or friends could find it i also remember winning wonderful cars pontiac or oldsmobile if the contestant got the final hidden picture game i even had the home versioni wonder why this game lasted so briefly i enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures  the only one i could ever get was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden streamreally good memories are connected with camouflage

975,this is undeniably the scariest game ive ever played its not the average shooteverythingthatmoves kind of fps which i usually dont care much for but the acceptable gfx interesting weapons and magic great surround soundeffects scryeeee scryeeee and above all incredible atmosphere i love the scrye which enables you at certain places in the games to see or hear events that happened there in the past the only game ive had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere im a great horror fan escpecially of clive barkers stories and movies and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story 910 1 because im no fps fan and perhaps the game was a bit short
976,this afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw neil gaimans stardust and all i can say is wowit is rare that i am completely taken aback by anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie i have ever seen maybe even the best movie of any kind and it is all neil gaimans faultsure i could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog which was smart flowed smoothlyand made the characters completely believablei could go on for days about the spectacular acting charlie cox is perfect as tristan claire daines is brilliant as yvaine and robert di nero almost steals the movie as the deeply in the closet pirate captian shakespearethe pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be laugh our loud funny intelligent enough to make the first shrek look like an 80s sitcom and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great moviespecial effects were near perfect true this was no lotr or star wars sf extravaganza but where they were use they were exactly what was called for not too much to distract you from the movie itself and blended into the story perfectlythen there is the story what can i say how often do you come across a story containing all of the classic fairytale formula components that doesnt just come off as another cheap princess bride knockoff it manages to be familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same timeany one of those things would have made this a good movie all of them combined make it a great movie but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world that those elements combine to bring to life well once again neil gaiman has done it he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that i would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it i didnt want it to end i wanted to be sucked through a vortex to the land of stormhold and get to meet tristan and yvaine in person to travel its fields and valleys stroll through its marketplaces and meet its residents both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever it is a feeling that i have noticed whenever i have read anything by gaiman the sandman american gods coraline all left me with a deep sense of sadness when i finished reading them because it was over i could not see anything more into the worlds he had created which seemed to be so much more vibrant and alive than the one i am forced to live in and watching stardust was no differentin the end im sure that neils writing and this movie wont have the same effect on everyone but trust me when i say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie it is easily one of the top 5 movies i have ever seen and i can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it
977,these slasher pics are past their sell by date but this one is good funthe valentine cards themselves are witty and well thought outthe film has one peach of a line hes no angel when he in fact is angel watching buffy reruns will never be the samethe cast is a sizzling display of young talent but the story does not give them enough real depth denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters sorry but nothe direction is very good managing to show very little actual gore and relying on your imaginations implied threat much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothesessentially the main directorial plus lies within the borrowing of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks psychos shower scene is tributed along with halloweens masking murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i knowlight viewing not very scary but a few good jump moments if it was a choice between the hole and this though choose the hole slasher movies have had their day and this is just another slasher a very good slasher but nothing groundbreaking
978,this is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art not an entertainment business lars von trier creates a noir atmosphere of postwar germany utterly captivating you get absorbed into the dream and youre let go only at the end credits the plot necessarily comes second but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised just wonderful
979,it is not an easy film to watch  it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character that it is in my humble opinion one of the very greatest films of all timethe film is depressing cynical and cruel if you want something uplifting see jacques rivettes fantastic céline and julie go boating which was made around the same time it shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to changeit involves a supposedly liberated ménageàtrois between alexandre played by jeanpierre leaud marie bernadette lafont and veronika francoise lebrun yet alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man the women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gazethe film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary french new wave this movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it jeanpierre leaud was one of the key actors of the new wave having starred among other films in the influential les quatres cent coups 1959 by francois truffaut as a rebellious teenager director jean eustache is not as well known as other directors from the new wave but he should bethere is no improvisation unlike in john cassavetess similar films made in the us and the dialogue comes from reallife conversations the film is resonant with eustaches personal experiences for example francoise lebrun was a former lover of eustache eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the reallife person that the character marie was based on did too the anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by veronika delivered directly to the audience breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film this mesmerising personal and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around
980,this film provides the saga of a legendary wild bill hickock he buffalo bill cody and calamity jane are the central charactersas the civil war closes lincoln mentions his concern that the countrys dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice go west young man which mercifully the film didnt erroneously attribute to horace greeley as a number of others did but then he gets assassinated and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the american indiansin the meantime we see wild bill hickock who interacts with a small boy while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the mississippi wild bill uses a bowie knife which he eventually gives to the boy calling it an arkansas toothpick which in reality was a different type of knife though both were used throughout the frontierhickock eventually meets buffalo bill cody who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man cody has just gotten married and is bringing his bride to the old west to settle downwhen they arrive at their destination they run into calamity jane who has a crush on hickock she looks at codys wife and asks buffalo bill is this your mopsy the line was one that caused the hayes board some problem since one definition of mopsy was prostitute demille wanted the line in and one of his aides pointed out that in beatrix potters books about peter rabbit three of the rabbits were flopsy mopsy and cottontail he pointed this out and asked the censors to identify the rabbit of ill virtue it worked the line stayed inthe indians were getting restless in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the eastern financiers cody and hickock were asked to help scout the area so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area cody led the troops hickock went to check out the activities of an indian chief who was an old acquaintance and who was leading some of the hostile indianscalamity jane gets captured and hickock gets captured trying to save her they are brought to the chief and although neither would talk torture applied to hickock breaks calamity janes willpower and she tells the route cody is usingthe two are released and hickock joins up with cody and his forces in part to alert them theyre walking into a trap with hickoks help they hold off the indian attackhickock decides to go after the gun runners and finally takes them prisoner as theyre waiting for authorities hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cardsthere are numerous historic anomalies in the film but it retains the flavor of legend pretty good for the 1930s
981,i seriously love this film so much i never get sick of watching it the only line i really cant stomach in this is when riff calls herself a teenage lobotomy but other than that everything else is perfect ive never been a fan of pj soles and it didnt help to hear that she didnt even know who the ramones were until she filmed this movie but i can ignore her snarly little face for the most part most people who watch this over and over are fans of the ramones and really thats the only reason i love it so much i never get tired of seeing deedee mess up his pizza lines or joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over haha one of the best parts of the film is seeing them sing do you want to dance  down the halls of the high school i love it the special edition dvd has a good retrospective surprisingly pj soles isnt on it maybe she was working on another project laugh anyway great film even better if youre a ramones fan
982,i need to be honest i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross offensive hilarious and raunchy yeah there is a lot of humor for all tastes if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards for example then you will have a great time for itor if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad you will also have a great time and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh  you will enjoy the showi enjoy all three kinds of humor that dirty sànchez offers i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show jackass is like a walk in the park compared to this one so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show with all due respectthis is a show that has little taste or class its not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed outnow these guys need to see a psychologist specially the paco character
983,the matador is a dark comedy starring pierce brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straightarrow happilymarried american businessman greg kinnear in mexico although the sardonic julian ironically surnamed noble appears to be a tough guy on the surface underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless thus on his birthday he reaches out to danny a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by julians unconventional lifestyle in fact both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter franker moments of selfevaluationalthough the film is a bit too reminiscent of analyze this and midnight run to feel entirely fresh and original the matador nevertheless earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting brosnan looking aged and almost used up sinks his teeth into the role of julian in a way he never has before playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment then genuine and sympathetic the next he always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale kinnear is also excellent as the regular joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the dark side as his relationship with julian deepens hope davis does a fine job as bean dannys loyal and loving wife who like her husband finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and dangerous figure from a world far different from the one she knowsat times we find ourselves feeling that the matador is holding something back from us not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise at the end it feels a little too light a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should this could be because this is the feature film debut for writerdirector richard shephard and he hasnt quite gotten his movie pacing down yet still one appreciates the fact that he doesnt always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laughthe matador is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will hopefully signal a new phase in brosnans acting career
984,in what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual revolution purposefully i use quotations for that word jean eustache wrote and directed the mother and the whore as a poetic damning critique of those who cant seem to get enough love if there is a message to this film and id hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this benhur length feature has to offer its that in order to love honestly there has to be some level of happiness of real truth is it possible to have two lovers some can try but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want or feel they can even express to say what they want what is the truth in the relationships that alexandre jeanpierre leaud has with the women around him hes a twentysomething pseudointellectual not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman marie bernadette lafont slightly older than him and is usually if not always his lover his last possible loveofhislife left him and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street veronika françoise lebrun who perhaps reminds him of her soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures at first we think it might be all about what will happen to alexandre but were mistaken the women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around talking on and on for something to sink inwere told that part of the sexual revolution in theory if not entirely in practice perhaps it was i cant say having not been alive in the period to see it firsthand was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions but eustaches point if not entirely message is that its practically impossible to have it both ways you cant have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with fing as the characters refer over and over again the mother and the whores strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity the lack of monogamy while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk youve ever seen in a movie at the same time we see a character like alexandre who probably loves to hear himself talk whether its about some movie he saw or something bad from his past eustache makes it so that the film itself isnt pretentious though it could appear to be but that its about pretentiousness what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws what they need to use when theyre ultimately alone in the morning if you thought films like before sunrisesunset were talky relationship flicks you havent met this but as eustache revels in the dialogs these characters have sometimes trivial or deep or sexual or frank or occasionally extremely or in a subdued manner emotional its never ever uninteresting or boring on the contrary for those who cant get enough of a good talky film its exceptional while his style doesnt call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand eustaches newwave touch is with the characters and then reverberating on themthis is realism with a spike of attitude with things at time scathing and sarcastic crude and without shame in expression all three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we cant ever perceive them as faking an emotion or going at all into melodrama its almost too good in naturalisticrealism terms but for eustaches material there is no other way around it luckily leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period and both ladies particularly labrun as the whore veronika a claim she staggeringly refutes in the films climax of sorts in one unbroken shot and as another touch every so often the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought of a character sitting by themselves listening to a record and in contemplation or quiet agony this is probably the biggest influence on jim jarmusch who dedicated his film broken flowers to eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely and lovingly in approach from the late parisiansad to say before i saw broken flowers i never heard of eustache or this film and procuring it has become quite a challenge not available on us dvd and on vhs so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries not a minute of that time was wasted the mother and the whore is truly beautiful work one of the best of french relationship dramas maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid ive seen from the country in general its complex its sweet its cold its absorbing and its very long perhaps too long its also satisfying on the kind of level that id compare to scenes from a marriage true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each films release
985,liked stanley  iris very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting arrangement the absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie
986,i found this to be a profoundly amusing dark comedy brosnan is genius as anyone will now testify he is not to be pigeonholed in the bond role kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role i dont know if ive laughed as hard during any movie what an unexpected pleasure my favourite line would be i feel like a bangkok hooker on a sunday after the navy left town brosnan delivered this very unbond line with such unexpected comedic finesse i was also very impressed with hope daviss performance it seems like everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy if you liked the dark and hilarious the weather man you will definitely like this i voted 10
987,read my lips tells of a strange symbiosis which develops between a plain socially maladroit female office worker devos and her workplace trainee a crude excon casel as the film fleshes out this unlikely duo down to their ids they become embroiled in a chilling merging of the minds each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome good stuff for anyone into characterdriven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents in french with easy to read subtitles and good translation b
988,i first saw this version of a christmas carol when it first appeared on television i actually anticipated seeing the film when it was advertised and it more than lived up to my expectations i have now purchased the dvd and plan to watch it every year with the exception of its a wonderful life i consider this version of a christmas carol one of the best christmas movies ever made george c scott is excellent and a superb cast led by roger rees surrounds him scott proves once again that he is one of finest actors of our time scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself how can someone be remembered as both patton and scrooge scott does so easily the direction is marvelous with the fine sets costumes and music that give the movie a special feeling of the time place and era depicted you will simply love this movie and will place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season
989,i was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers i saw it one late night on tv and it hit the spot  i actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared yet i remember it pretty well with a nice twist or two and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm michael pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead i definitely recommend it as a rental although some of the themes which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989 now may seem tame which is a shame considering that contemporary edginess is often just used as a necessary marketing tool sort of like clamoring just to get noticed
990,okay this show is nothing but awesome it has a great story line and plot and great actors and actresses jeremy sumpter is so hott and he is perfect for the role he is gunna be big in hollywood he has a bright future ahead this show better last a long time because i really love this show and i hope that it has a lot of success it is so interesting i have been waiting for it to come out for about 6 or 7 months and its finally here and its great i tape it too i can watch it whenever i want now too bad its only on once a week though i wish it was on at least twice a week because now i wish that it was tuesday every day hope you all like this showashley
991,the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game so many people have seen this film and just dont get it and i dont understand why while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which floored me i will try to explain this without any spoilers but be forewarned i do talk about things that happen in the movie possible spoilers  be forewarnedhis is a life of large moves versus small moves he chooses natalia to be his queen and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy listen closely to that descriptionwhen someone asks him a question he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves the flashbacks are beautifully lit by the way the flashbacks are quite interesting as well for they give not only his point of view as a child but the point of view of the other character as well its stunningvarious characters become either his helpers or his enemies pawns bishops and knights their actions enlightening you as to whos side they are on even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on beautifully donei will not comment more on what happens to the character of luhzin but i hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the endthis film is constantly working on many levels which is why i endorse it it was a treat and a joy to watchif you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces
992,emilio miraglios the red queen kills seven times 1972 is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that i have ever seen mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed first of all and of paramount importance for me it has a complex twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end the story concerning a series of gruesome murders you already know how many from the films title right that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters is an involving one and the murderer a redcloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman is both frightening and memorable every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses and here we have quite an assortment headed by the ridiculously beautiful barbara bouchet as one of the two sisters and in one of her earlier roles sybil danning as a lustful tramp at barbaras fashion house another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy hummable score and bruno nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days gorgeous scenery check again filmed largely in wurzburg germany the picture is a treat for the eye indeed ok ok but what about those murders after all isnt that what gialli are all about well im pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings shootings impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes outnot to mention the crypts freaky dream sequence rats and bats and lots of em too the drug references a rape scene the obligatory red herrings and in the person of ugo pagliai a hunky leading man for the female viewers as i said a perfect giallo and even better this dvd is from the fine folks at no shame and you know what that means a gorgeous print and loads of extras to boot thanks guys
993,i had no expectations id never heard of jamie foxx all i knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it i thought it was highly entertaining it was fun the plot was different and unpredictable enough to hold my interest to me foxx is an original david morse is terrific true this is not his finest role i thought the chases and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and were well done i didnt expect a lot and i was happily surprised
994,when i saw the elaborate dvd box for this and the dreadful red queen figurine i felt certain i was in for a big disappointment but surprise surprise i loved it convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles let alone take in the ridiculous explanation these quibbles apart however the film is a dream fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful bruno nicolai score he may not be morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so really enjoyable with lots of colour plenty of sexiness some gory kills and minimal police interference super
